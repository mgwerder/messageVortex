% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
 \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
 \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we introduce an unobservable message anonymization protocol, named MessageVortex. It bases on the zero trust principle and a distributed peer-to-peer like architecture and avoids central aspects such as fixed infrastructures within a global network. 

It scores over existing work by blending its traffic into suitable existing transport protocols, thus making it next to impossible to block it without significantly affecting regular users of the transport medium. No additional protocol-specific infrastructure is required in public networks and allows a sender to control all aspects of a message such as the degree of anonymity, timing, and redundancy of the message transport without disclosing any of these details to the routing or transporting nodes. The most recent RFC-draft describes the protocol in detail. This draft contains all the necessary information to build protocol nodes. More information and a prototype implementation are available under \url{https://messagevortex.net/}.

%

\IEEEPARstart{A}{lmon Brown Strowger} was the owner of a funeral parlor in St. Petersburg. He filed a patent on March \nth{10}, 1891 for an ``Automatic Telephone Exchange'' \cite{pulseDialingPatent}. This patent built the base for modern automated telephone systems. According to several sources, he was annoyed by the fact that the local telephone operator was married to another undertaker. She diverted potential customers of Mr. Strowger to her husband instead, which caused Almon B. Strowger to lose business. In 1922, this telephone dialing system, which is nowadays called pulse dialing became the standard dialing technology for more than 70 years until tone dialing replaced it.

This dialing technology enabled automatic messaging for voice and text messages (e.g., telex) up until today and is the foundation for current routed networks. These networks build the base for our communication-based Society these days and allow us to connect quickly with any person or company of our wish. We use these networks today as communication meaning for all purposes, and most of the people spend minimal thoughts on the possible consequences arising if someone puts hands on this communication. 

Collected data may be used to judge upon our intentions and thus is not only confidential if we have something to hide. This problem has dramatically increased in the last years as big companies and countries started to collect all kinds of data and created the means to process them. It allows, supposedly, to judge peoples not only on what they are doing but as well, on what they did and what they might do. Numerous events in the present and past show that multiple actors, some of which are state-sponsored, collected data on a broad base within the Internet. Whether this is a problem or not may be disputable. Undisputed is that such data requires careful handling, and accusations should then base on solid facts. Unacceptable seems the use of ``guesses'' or ``extrapolations'' in most of the cases.

To show that this may happen even under complete democratic control we might refer to events such as the ``secret files scandal'' (or  ``Fichenskandal'') in Switzerland. In the years from 1900 to 1990 Swiss government collected 900’000 files in a secret archive (covering roughly 10\% of the natural and juristic entities within Switzerland at that time). The Swiss Federal Archives (https://www.bar.admin.ch) documents more about the Fichenskandal.

Whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked a vast amount of documents. These documents suggested that such attacks on privacy are commonly made on a global scale. The documents leaked in 2009 and a significant number of journalists from multiple countries screened them (\href{http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/11/23/nederland-sinds-1946-doelwit-van-nsa}{NRC}). According to these documents, NSA infiltrated more than 50k computers with malware to collect classified or personal information. They furthermore infiltrated Telecom-Operators (mainly executed by British GCHQ) such as Belgacom to collect data and targeted high member of governments even in associated states (such as the mobile phone number of Germany's president and high ranking members of economy and finance).

This list of events shows that big players are collecting and storing vast amounts of data for analysis or possible future use. The list of events also shows that the use of this data has in the past been at least partially questionable. As a part of possible countermeasures, this work analyses the possibility of using state-of-the-art technology to minimize the information footprint of a person on the Internet. 

We leave a large information footprint in our daily communication. On a regular email, we disclose everything in an ``postcard'' to any entity on its way. Even when encrypting a message perfectly with today's technology (S/MIME\cite{RFC2045} or PGP\cite{RFC2015}) it still leaves at least the originating and the receiving entity disclosed, or we rely on the promises of a third party provider which offers a proprietary solution. Even in those cases, we leak pieces of information such as ``message subject'', ``frequency of exchanged messages'', ``size of messages'', or ``client being used''. A suitable anonymity protocol has therefore not only a message to hide but additional attributes as well. It includes besides the message itself, all metadata, and all the traffic flows. Furthermore, a protocol to anonymize messages should not rely on the trust of infrastructure other than the infrastructure under control of the sending or receiving entity. Trust in any third party might be misleading in terms of security.

Central infrastructure is bound to be of particular interest to anyone gathering data. It may furthermore allow manipulating the system or the data or the data flow. So, avoiding a central infrastructure is a good thing.

Leaving no information trail when sending information from one person to another is hard to achieve. Most messaging systems disclose at least the peer partners when sending messages. Metadata such as starting and endpoints, frequency, or message size are leaked in all standard systems even when encrypting messages.

Allowing an entity to collect data may affect senders and recipients of any information. Collection of vast amounts of data allows a potent adversary to build a  profile of a person. Unlike in the past, the availability of this kind of information has been risen to a never known extend with the Internet.

An entity in possession of such Profiles may use them for many purposes. These include service adoption, directed advertising, or classification of citizens. The examples given above show that the effects of this data is not limited to the Internet but reaches us effectively in the real world.

The main problem of this data is that it may be collected over a considerable amount of time and evaluated at any time. It even happened that standard practices of the time are judged differently upon later. Persons may then be judged retrospectively upon these types of practice. This questionable type of judgment is visible in the tax avoidance discussion. 

People must be able to control their data footprint. Not providing these means does effectively allow any country or a bigger player to ban and control any number of persons within or outside the Internet.  

In this work, a new protocol is designed to allow message transfer through existing communication channels. These messages are next to unobservable to any third party. This unobservability does not only cover the message itself but all metadata and flows associated with it. We called this protocol ``MessageVortex'' or in short just ``Vortex''. The protocol is designed in such a way so that it is capable of using a wide variety of transport protocols. It is even possible to switch protocols while the messages are transferred. This behavior allows media breaches (at least on a protocol level) and makes analysis even harder.

The new protocol allows secure communication without the need for trusting the underlying transport media. Furthermore, the usage of the protocol itself is possible without altering the immediate behavior of the transport layer. That way it is possible to use the transport layers regular traffic to increase the noise in which information has to be searched. 

\subsection{About Unlinkability, Unobservability, Undetectability and Censorship resistance}
From an academic point of view, achieving anonymity is relatively simple. All we need is a trusted party distributing the messages while making sure that no trace from the sender arrives at the recipient. Unlinkability, as defined in \cite{anon_terminology} is much harder to achieve. It requires that a specified attacker is unable to link a sender and recipients of a message. Even if a system provides unlinkable message transfer, it is most probable prone to denial of service and thus partial or full censorship. By introducing a global observer or infiltrating parts of the system, an attacker may gain insight into the messages transported by the system and thus leaking information.

So to be censorship resistant, a protocol requires many critical, unobvious properties. As outlined It should be undetectable from the outside. From within the system, we need to provide a mean to make it very hard to follow message flows or identify participants.

MessageVortex is a protocol providing censorship resistance under ideal circumstances. It does this using a rigid design from bottom up to provide the required properties. While being a protocol on its own, it uses many standard protocols. Partly to provide user-friendliness, but mostly to hide within the regular network flows. As such, a protocol requires to be undetectable on the network. A protocol all alone may not be undetectable as each protocol sends data over a network. This data is detectable. To be undetectable, a censorship-resistant protocol requires to be embedded undetectably in legit message flows. Such embedding is usually done either by side channel transmissions or by employing steganography. Our protocol may use both but will use typically the later. 

\subsection{Adversary Model}
For our adversary, we need to assume someone of the capabilities of a state-sponsored actor. State-sponsored actors may work these days with allies but will not achieve dominance over all jurisdictional domains.

For our adversary model we assume the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An adversary will have elaborated technical know-how to attack any infrastructure.
	\item An adversary may have the capability to monitor traffic at many points in most networks within a jurisdiction.
	\item An adversary may have the capability to modify routing information within a jurisdiction freely.
	\item An adversary may have the possibility to freely modify even cryptographically weak secured data where a single or a limited number of entities grant proof of authenticity or privacy.
	\item An adversary may have the possibility to inject or modify any data on the network of a jurisdiction.
	\item An adversary may create own nodes of a network. He may furthermore monitor their behavior and data flow to the maximum possible extent.
	\item An adversary may force a limited number of other non-allied nodes to expose their data to him.
	\item An adversary may have a similar access to resources as within its jurisdiction in a limited number of other jurisdictions.
\end{itemize}

We assume the following goals for an adversary:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An adversary may want to disrupt non-authorized communication.
	\item An adversary may want to read any information passing throughout the internet.
	\item An adversary may want to build and conserve data about individuals or groups of individuals of their life. This data includes all activities in any part of their life regardless of their apparent fitness for any specific purpose or their correctness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notation \label{sec:encNot}}
The theory in this document is heavily based on symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing. To use an uniformed notation we use $E^{K_a}(M)$ (where $a$ is an index to distinguish multiple keys) for an encrypting function with a key $K_a$. This results in $\mathbf{M^{K_a}}$ for the encrypted message. If we are reflecting a tuple of information, we write in boldface. To express a concatenated set of information, we use angular brackets $\mathbf{L\langle normalAddress,vortexAddress\rangle }$. If we want to differentiate messages encrypted with multiple keys, we list the used keys as a comma-separated list in superscript $E^{K_b}\left(E^{K_a}\left(M\right)\right)=M^{{K_{a}},{K_b}}$.

For a symmetric encryption of a message $\mathbf{M}$ with a key $K_a$ resulting in $\mathbf{M^{K_a}}$ where $a$ is an index to distinguish different keys. Decryption uses therefore $D^{K_a}(\mathbf{M^{K_a}})=\mathbf{M}$.

As notation for asymetric encryption we use $E^{K^{1}_a}(\mathbf{M})$ where as $K^{-1}_a$ is the private key and $K^{1}_a$ is the public key of a key pair $K^p_a$. The asymmetric decryption is noted as $D^{K^{-1}_a}(\mathbf{M})$.

For hashing, we do use $H(\mathbf{M})$ if unsalted and $H^{S_a}$ if using a salted hash with salt $S_a$. The generated hash is shown as $H_M$ if unsalted and $H^{S_a}_M$ if salted.

If we want to express what details contained in a tuple we use the the notation $\mathbf{M\langle t,MURB,serial\rangle }$ respectively if encrypted $\mathbf{M^{K_{a}}\langle t,MURB,serial\rangle}$.

\begin{align*}
\text{asymetric:}         & E^{K^{-1}_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)                        	&& =\mathbf{M}^{K^{-1}_a}\\
& D^{K^{1}_a}\left(E^{K^{-1}_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)\right)	&& =\mathbf{M}\\
& D^{K^{-1}_a}\left(E^{K^{1}_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)\right)	&& =\mathbf{M}\\
\text{symetric:}          & E^{K_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)                             	&& =\mathbf{M}^{K_a}\\
& D^{K_a}\left(E^{K_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)\right)          && =\mathbf{M}\\
\text{hashing (unsalted):}& H\left(\mathbf{M}\right)                                   	&& =\mathbf{H}_M\\
\text{hashing (salted):}  & H^{S_a}\left(\mathbf{M}\right)                             	&& =\mathbf{H}^{S_a}_M
\end{align*}

In general Subscripts denote selectors to differentiate values of the same type and superscript denote relevant parameters to operations expressed. The subscripted and superscripted information may be omitted where not needed.

We refer to the components of a Vortex Message as follows:
\begin{align*}
\text{Prefix component:}         & \mathbf{PREFIX}             	&=D^{K^{1}_a}\left(\mathbf{P}^{K^{-1}_a}\right) &=D\left(\mathbf{P}\right)\\
\text{Header component:}         & \mathbf{HEAD}             	&=D^{K^{1}_a}\left(\mathbf{H}^{K^{-1}_a}\right) &=D\left(\mathbf{H}\right)\\
\text{Route component:}         & \mathbf{ROUTE}             	&=D^{K^{1}_a}\left(\mathbf{R}^{K^{-1}_a}\right) &=D\left(\mathbf{R}\right)\\
\end{align*}

In general a decrypted Block is written as capitalized multi character boldface. An encrypted Block is written as capitalized single character boldface.

\section{The MessageVortex Protocol}

\subsection{General Design}
In this section, we introduce a new consistent, transport independent model for representing the different protocols used by MessageVortex.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../../inc/roughProtocolDesign.pdf}
	\caption{A rough protocol outline of the MessageVortex protocol}\label{fig:protocolOutline}
\end{figure}

The protocol handles messages which are passed by a transport protocol from node to node. In each node a sender has a so called identity with an assigned workspace. In these workspaces messages may be assembled, transformed, or decomposed. Results are sent to other nodes. Due to the nature of the operations all messages passed on may be decoy traffic or ``real messsage parts''. A node will know that a message is destined for it when a message results in data in specific parts of the identities workspace.

We divide our protocol into four different layers, whereas only three are specific to the MessageVortex protocol. The lowest layer is the transport layer. As expressed earlier, dedicated protocols are easy to censor. Therefore we build our protocol on top of other suitable transport protocols. 

The other Three layers are Vortex-specific and do not require any infrastructure on the Internet. We elaborate further on these layers in section \ref{sec:transportAndBlending} and section \ref{sec:routingAndAccounting}.

For our first tests, we used a custom transport layer allowing us to monitor all traffic quickly, and build structures in a very flexible way. This transport layer works locally with a minimum amount of work for setup and deployment. It furthermore works across multiple hosts in a broadcast domain. The API may be used to support almost any kind of transport layer. After that, we focused on the protocols identified suitable as transport protocols:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SMTP
	\item XMPP
\end{itemize}
For the prototype, we have implemented an SMTP transport agent and the respective blending layer.

The blending layer is taking care of multiple problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Translating the message block into the transport format\\
	This translation includes jobs such as embedding a block as encoded text, as a binary attachment or hide it within a message using steganography.
	\item Extract incoming messages from transport\\
	Identify incoming messages containing a possible block and extract it from the message.
	\item Do housekeeping on the storage layer\\
	Access protocols POP and IMAP require that messages are deleted from time to time in order to stay below the sizing quotas of an account.      
\end{itemize}

We define the blending layer to work as follows when receiving messages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Log arrival time (in UTC) on the transport layer.
	\item Extract possible blocks.
	\item Apply decryption on a suspected header block.
	\item Validate the header block using the accounting layer.
	\item Process header requests (if any)
	\item Extract and decrypt subsequent blocks.
	\item Pass extracted blocks and information to the routing layer.
\end{enumerate}

We define the blending layer to work as follows for sending messages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Assemble message as passed on by the routing layer.
	\item Using the blending method specified in the routing block build an empty message. 
	\item Create a message decoy content.
	\item Send the message to the appropriate recipient using the transport layer protocol.
\end{enumerate}

The routing layer receives the message blocks in a decrypted and authorized form from the blending layer. The routing layer then assembles all information of an identity and makes executes the accepted operations using the available data. 

Tasks of the transport layer are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build structure representing the block building and the appropriate block IDs.
	\item Schedule all Routing blocks for processing in an priority queue.
	\item Authorize all routing blocks ready for processing with the calculated block sizes.
	\item Process blocks.
	\item Send prepared building blocks to the Blending layer.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Identities and Keys}
Several keys are being used during the life of a message. In the following section, we emphasize on the type, the usage, and their specialties.

\subsubsection{Peer key}
The peer key is a message specific symmetrical key known to two adjacent routing nodes. It is generated by the sending routing node and encrypted with the public key of the receiving nodes identity key.

\subsubsection{Header Key}
The header key is a symmetric key protecting the routing and ephemeral identity information of the message. It is prepended to the header section and protected by the identity key of the processing node.

The Identity key is a static, asymmetric keypair existing on a per user base used to sign messages or encrypt symmetric keys. We refer here as a user any peer participating in the message stream. Every user participating in the Vortex network requires at least one key pair. Depending on the use-case (e.g., unlikable signatures or scalable security) a user may use multiple key pairs at the same time.

An ephemeral identity key identifies the sender to a processing host. The ephemeral identity key must be handled in such a way that it is not linkable. It is mainly used to process accounting information.

\subsection{Messages}
The outline in figure \ref{fig:messageOutline} is a simplified view of the message block of MessageVortex.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../inc/blockLayoutSimplified}
	\caption{Simplified message outline}
	\label{fig:messageOutline}
\end{figure*}

A Vortex message is a message passed from one router to another this message may or may not contain any valuable information. Binary data represents the message content in the transfer protocol. Every router may decide for himself on the support of algorithms and embedding mechanisms.

The block structure of a Vortex message is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item header
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Encrypted message key.\\
		Contains symmetrical key for decryption of follow up header information and payload blocks. All symmetric keys are encrypted with a receiving host's public key.
		\item Identity and ``proof of work'' information\\
		This information contains requests, proof-of-work sections, and a header key.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Encrypted payload blocks (encrypted with header key)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Routing blocks (encrypted with message key)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Next hop timing instructions
			\item Next hop routing blocks (encrypted)
			\item Next hop header
			\item Message build instructions.
			\item Next hop header key and spec.
			\item Next hop blending instructions.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Payload chunk blocks
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that there are two symmetrical keys involved in encrypting and decrypting message headers. Having two keys is not a flaw in the protocol but necessary. 

The first key of a Vortex message is the message key. This key is only accessible with the private key of the node receiving the message. It allows decryption of the routing blocks and the header information. The sender of a message block is therefore not able to tell if a message contains one or more routing blocks. It is important to note that no other node should have access to this information. 

The second key is the header key located in the encrypted header. The RBB chooses the key. This key protects the inner structure of the Message. It makes it impossible for any node except the sending or the receiving peer node to detect the inner structure of the message. Without this key, any independent observer with knowledge about the blending capabilities of a receiving node may:
\begin{itemize}
	\item easier identify the block structure.\\ 
	This remains the case regardless of whether ASN.1 or length prefixed structures are used. If the structure of a vortex Message can be easily identified the messages may be logged or dropped.
	\item Identify the routing block size.\\
	The value of this information is only minimal as it only reflects the complexity of the remaining routing information indirectly.
	\item Identify the number of payload blocks and their respective sizes. \\
	This is valuable information when following traffic of a message.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transport and Blending Layer\label{sec:transportAndBlending}}
The tuple of Transport and Blending layer builds the main core functionality when it comes to the undetectability property. In order to avoid transport protocol misuse and unintentional exit nodes of the protocol the original RBL has no control over the transported content except for the hidden VortexMessage and how it is embedded. This loads the burden of sensible clear text payload generation to blending layer. It is relatively easy to generate a credible clear text message to pass an automated testing engine. This can be easily proven by looking at the effectivity of junk mail filters. These filters have tremendous problems continuosly adapting to the new types of unsolicited bulk emails (UBE).

Things do however drastically change if taking a human censor into account.

\subsubsection{Applied Steganography and the Dead Parrot}
A human censor is able to take very complex information into account when it comes to analyses of message content. He is able to not only analyze a message for its true content, but he may also see the message in the context of other messages. In \cite{oakland2013-parrot} is expressed that it is easy for a human to determine decoy traffic as the content is easily identifiable as generated content. While this is true, there is a possibility here to generate ``human-like'' data traffic to a certain extent. As an adversary may not assume that his messages are replied to, the problem does not boil down to a true Turing test. It remains on a ``passive observer Turing test'', enabling the potential nodes to choose their messages. 

For steganography we decided to go for F5\cite{f5}. It is a reasonably well-researched algorithm which attracted many researchers. The original F5 implementation had a detectable issue with artifacts\cite{F5broken} caused by the recompression of the image. This issue was caused only due to an issue in the reference implementation, and the researchers have provided a corrected reference implementation without the weakness. Like always the type of embedding may be specified and replaced upon request. 

\subsection{Routing and Accounting\label{sec:routingAndAccounting}}
Each routing layer does the anonymization operations. These operations should make sure that no message may be identified unless destined for the current node. 

\subsection{The Core: Operations}
We differentiate three types of operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Splitting and merging of chunks
	\item Encryption and decryption of chunks
	\item Redundancy calculations carried out on chunks
\end{itemize}

The first two Operations don not really provide a high level of unlinkability as they do allow analysis such as hotspot analysis and produce continuously inclining, steady or declining message sizes depending on the type of use. The third operation however adds a whole lot of new possibilities in conjunction with the other two.

\subsubsection{Splitting and Merging}
The splitPayload operation splits a payload block into two chunks of different or equal sizes. The parameters for this operation are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item source payload block $pb_1$
	\item fraction $f$\\
	A floating-point number which is describing the size of the first chunk. If the fraction is ``1.0'', then the whole payload is transferred to the second target chunk
\end{itemize}

If $len(pb_1)$ expresses the size of a payloadblock called $pb_1$ in bytes then the two resulting blocks of the SpitPayload Operation $pb_2$ and $pb_3$ have to follow the following rules:

\begin{eqnarray}
split(f, pb_1) & = &\langle pb_1, pb_2 \rangle\\
pb_1.startsWith(pb_2)\\
pb_1.endsWith(pb_3)\\
len(pb_2) & = & floor(len(pb_1)\cdot f)\\
len(pb_1) & = & len(pb_2) + len(pb_3)
\end{eqnarray}

The mergePayload operation combines two payload blocks into one. The parameters for this operation are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item first source payload block $pb_1$
	\item second source payload block $pb_2$
\end{itemize}

If $len(pb)$ expresses the size of a payloadblock called $pb$ in bytes then resulting block of the MergePayload Operation $pb_3$ have to follow the following rules:

\begin{eqnarray}
merge(pb_1, pb_2) & = & pb_3 \\
pb_3.startsWith(pb_1)\\
pb_3.endsWith(pb_2)\\
len(pb_3) & = & len(pb_1) + len(pb_2)
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Encryption and Decryption}
The encryptPayload operation encrypts a payload block $pb_1$ symmetrically resulting in a block $pb_2$. The length of block $pb_2$ may vary according to mode and padding chosen. The parameters for this operation are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Source payload block $pb_1$
	\item Encryption specification $spec$
	\item Symmetric key $k$
\end{itemize}

The operation follows the following rules (please note section \ref{sec:encNot} for notation):
\begin{eqnarray}
encrypt(pb_1, spec, k) & = & pb_2 \\
pb_2 & = & E_{spec}^{K_a}\left( pb_1 \right)\\\
len(pb_2) & \geq & len(pb_1)
\end{eqnarray}


The decryptPayload operation decrypts a payload block $pb_1$ symmetrically resulting in a block $pb_2$. The length of block $pb_2$ may vary according to mode and padding chosen. The parameters for this operation are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Source payload block $pb_1$
	\item Decryption specification $spec$
	\item Symmetric key $k$
\end{itemize}

The operation follows the following rules (please note section \ref{sec:encNot} for notation):
\begin{eqnarray}
decrypt(pb_1, spec, k) & = & pb_2 \\
pb_2 & = & D_{spec}^{K_a}\left( pb_1 \right)\\\
len(pb_2) & \leq & len(pb_1)
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Redundancy Operations}
These operations build the core of the mixing operations. The operation allows to add to a message redundancy information or to rebuild a block from a chosen set of information. 

The Operation itself is shown in \ref{fig:addRedundancyOperation}. 
\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{../../inc/addRedundancyOp}
	\caption{Outline of the addRedundancy operation}
	\label{fig:addRedundancyOperation}
\end{figure}
It may be subdivided into the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pad the original message block in such a way, that all resulting blocks are a multiple of the block size of the encrypting cipher.
	\item Apply a Reed Solomon operation in a given GF space with a vanderMonde matrix.
	\item Encrypt all resulting blocks with unpadded, symmetrical encryption.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage of the Protocol}

\section{Discussion of the Results}
\subsection{Static Protocol Analysis}
\subsubsection{Endpoint Operation}
\subsection{Dynamic Protocol Analysis}

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping of Addresses and Identities}

\subsubsection{Discovery of Peer Nodes}

\subsection{The Missing Links}
A lot still needs to be done. For this protocol to be of any use, a user-friendly implementation is required. This implementation must provide very good censorship resistance while providing easy to use recipes for message transfer. 

For the traffic to be truly undetectable AIs must generate meaningful conversation between agents. This conversation does not necessarily boil down to a turing test. It is sufficient that two blending layer are capable to set up a communication which is undestinguishible from a normal human communication. As an adversary is typically not able to generate own traffic without exposing the probing activity and a blender is not required to such probes an attacker is very limited.

\section{Conclusion}
Creating a possibly censorship resistant protocol is already hard. Analysis showed that even when a protocol is crafted with great care braking unobservability is far easier than doing it right. At the same time we were able to present a system which requires an unmatched amount of observation and calculation power to be broken.
