  abstract     = {Hidden services were deployed on the Tor anonymous communication network in 2004. Announced properties include server resistance to distributed DoS. Both the E and Reporters Without Borders have issued guides that describe using hidden services via Tor to protect the safety of dissidents as well as to resist censorship. We present fast and cheap attacks that reveal the location of a hidden server. Using a single hostile Tor node we have located deployed hidden servers in a matter of minutes. Although we examine hidden services over Tor, our results apply to any client using a variety of anonymity networks. In fact, these are the first actual intersection attacks on any deployed public network: thus confirming general expectations from prior theory and simulation. We recommend changes to route selection design and implementation for Tor. These changes require no operational increase in network overhead and are simple to make; but they prevent the attacks we have demonstrated. They have been implemented.},

Receiver k-anonymity places a similar guarantee on the receiver:an adversary, at best, can only narrow down the possible receivers to a set of size k. In this paperwe introduce the notions of sender and receiver k-anonymity and consider their applications.We show that there exist simple and efficient protocols which are k-anonymous for both thesender and the receiver in a model where a polynomial time adversary can see all traffic in thenetwork and can control up to a constant fraction of the participants. Our protocol is provablysecure, practical, and does not require the existence of trusted third parties. This paper alsoprovides a conceptually simple augmentation to Chaums DC-Nets that adds robustness againstadversaries who attempt to disrupt the protocol through perpetual transmission or selectivenon-participation.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymity is considered as a valuable property as far as everyday transactions in the Internet are concerned. Users care about their privacy and they seek for new ways to keep secret as much as of their personal information from third parties. Anonymizing systems exist nowadays that provide users with the technology, which is able to hide their origin when they use applications such as the World Wide Web or Instant Messaging. However, all these systems are vulnerable to a number of attacks and some of them may collapse under a low strength adversary. In this paper we explore anonymity from a different perspective. Instead of building a new anonymizing system, we try to overload an existing file sharing system, Gnutella, and use it for a different purpose. We develop a technique that transforms Gnutella as an Anonymizing System (GAS) for a single download from the World Wide Web.},

  abstract     = {Tor has become one of the most popular overlay networks for anonymizing TCP traffic. Its popularity is due in part to its perceived strong anonymity properties and its relatively low latency service. Low latency is achieved through Tor's ability to balance the traffic load by optimizing Tor router selection to probabilistically favor routers with highbandwidth capabilities.

We investigate how Tor's routing optimizations impact its ability to provide strong anonymity. Through experiments conducted on PlanetLab, we show the extent to which routing performance optimizations have left the system vulnerable to end-to-end traffic analysis attacks from non-global adversaries with minimal resources. Further, we demonstrate that entry guards, added to mitigate path disruption attacks, are themselves vulnerable to attack. Finally, we explore solutions to improve Tor's current routing algorithms and propose alternative routing strategies that prevent some of the routing attacks used in our experiments.},

The technique does not require a universally trusted authority. One correspondent can remain anonymous to a second, while allowing the second to respond via an untraceable return address.
The technique can also be used to form rosters of untraceable digital pseudonyms from selected applications. Applicants retain the exclusive ability to form digital signatures corresponding to their pseudonyms. Elections in which any interested party can verify that the ballots have been properly counted are possible if anonymously mailed ballots are signed with pseudonyms from a roster of registered voters. Another use allows an individual to correspond witha record-keeping organization under a unique pseudonym which appears in a roster of acceptable clients.},

  Abstract                 = {We identify two vulnerabilities for existing high-speed network-layer anonymity protocols, such as LAP andDovetail. First, the header formats of LAP and Dovetail leakpath information, reducing the anonymity-set size when an ad-versary launches topological attacks. Second, ASes can launchsession hijacking attacks to deanonymize destinations. HOR-NET addresses these problems but incurs additional band-width overhead and latency.In this paper, we propose PHI, a Path-HIdden lightweightanonymity protocol that solves both challenges while main-taining the same level of efficiency as LAP and Dovetail. Wepresent an efficient packet header format that hides path in-formation and a new back-off setup method that is compati-ble with current and future network architectures. Our exper-iments demonstrate that PHI expands anonymity sets of LAPand Dovetail by over 30x and reaches 120 Gbps forwardingspeed on a commodity software router.},

  Abstract                 = {In Year 2005, Internet users were twice more likely to receive unsolicited electronic messages, known as spams, than regular emails. Proof of work protocols are designed to deter such phenomena and other denial-of-service attacks by requiring computed stamps based on hard-to-solve problems with easy-to-verify solutions. As cpu-intensive computations are badly hit over time by Moore's law, memory-bound computations have been suggested to deal with heterogeneous hardware. We introduce new practical, optimal, proven and possibly memory-bound functions suitable to these protocols, in which the client-side work to compute the response is intrinsically exponential with respect to the server-side work needed to set or check the challenge. One-way non-interactive solution-verification variants are also presented. Although simple implementations of such functions are bound by memory latency, optimized versions are shown to be bound by memory bandwidth instead.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the security requirements for creating a Deniable File System (DFS), and the efficacy with which the TrueCrypt disk-encryption software meets those requirements. We find that the Windows Vista operating system itself, Microsoft Word, and Google Desktop all compromise the deniability of a TrueCrypt DFS. While staged in the context of TrueCrypt, our research highlights several fundamental challenges to the creation and use of any DFS: even when the file system may be deniable in the pure, mathematical sense, we find that the environment surrounding that file system can undermine its deniability, as well as its contents. We hypothesize some extensions of our discoveries to regular (non-deniable) encrypted file systems. Finally, we suggest approaches for overcoming these challenges on modern operating systems like Windows. We analyzed TrueCrypt version 5.1a (latest available version during the writing of the paper); Truecrypt v6 introduces new features, including the ability to create deniable operating systems, which we have not studied.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2005, Murdoch and Danezis demonstrated the first practical congestion attack against a deployed anonymity network. They could identify which relays were on a target Tor users path by building paths one at a time through every Tor relay and introducing congestion. However, the original attack was performed on only 13 Tor relays on the nascent and lightly loaded Tor network. We show that the attack from their paper is no longer practical on todays 1500-relay heavily loaded Tor network. The attack doesnt scale because a) the attacker needs a tremendous amount of bandwidth to measure enough relays during the attack window, and b) there are too many false positives now that many other users are adding congestion at the same time as the attacks. We then strengthen the original congestion attack by combining it with a novel bandwidth amplification attack based on a flaw in the Tor design that lets us build long circuits that loop back on themselves. We show that this new combination attack is practical and effective by demonstrating a working attack on todays deployed Tor network. By coming up with a model to better understand Tors routing behavior under congestion, we further provide a statistical analysis characterizing how effective our attack is in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether it is port scans, spam, or distributed denial-of-service attacks from botnets, unwanted traffic is a fundamental problem in all networked systems. Although proof-of-work has been proposed as a mechanism for thwarting such attacks, few proof-of-work systems have been successfully deployed. One of the problems in the proof-of-work approach is that the systems that issue and verify puzzles are typically located at or near the server edge. Rather than eliminate the denial-of-service problem, such approaches merely shift the problem from the service itself to the proof-of-work systems protecting the service. As a result, adversaries can disable services by flooding the issuer, by flooding the verifier, or by flooding all of the network links that lead to the issuer and verifier. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new approach for building proof-of-work systems based on publicly verifiable client puzzles. The system works by issuing a single "public work function" that clients must solve for each of its subsequent requests. Because the work function is publicly verifiable, any network device at the client's edge can verify that subsequent traffic will be accepted by the service. The system mitigates floods to the issuer since only a single work function needs to be given per client, thus allowing duplicate requests and replies to be supressed. The system mitigates floods to the verifier and across links leading to the server edge by allowing the verifier to be placed arbitrarily close to the client adversary.},

  Abstract                 = {Client puzzles have been proposed in a number of protocols as a mechanism for mitigating the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.},

  Abstract                 = {Tarzan is a peer-to-peer anonymous IP network overlay. Because it provides IP service, Tarzan is general-purpose and transparent to applications. Organized as a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay, Tarzan is fault-tolerant, highly scalable, and easy to manage. Tarzan achieves its anonymity with layered encryption and multihop routing, much like a Chaumian mix. A message initiator chooses a path of peers pseudo-randomly through a restricted topology in a way that adversaries cannot easily influence. Cover traffic prevents a global observer from using traffic analysis to identify an initiator. Protocols toward unbiased peer-selection offer new directions for distributing trust among untrusted entities. Tarzan provides anonymity to either clients or servers, without requiring that both participate. In both cases, Tarzan uses a network address translator (NAT) to bridge between Tarzan hosts and oblivious Internet hosts. Measurements show that Tarzan imposes minimal overhead over
a corresponding non-anonymous overlay route.},

One of the basic properties of the current electronic communication means is the identi cation of the end-points. However, at times it is desirable or even critical to hide the identity and/or whereabouts of theend-points (e.g., human users) involved.
This paper discusses the goals and desired properties of anonymous email in general and introduces the design and salient features of Babel anonymous remailer. Babel allows email users to converse electronically while remaining anonymous with respect to each other and to other -- even hostile -- parties. A range of attacks and corresponding countermeasures is considered. An attempt is made to formalize and quantify certain dimensions of anonymity and untraceable communication.},

In this paper, we describe Herbivore, a peer-to-peer, scalable, tamper-resilient communication system that provides provable anonymity and privacy. Building on dining cryptographer networks, Herbivore scales by partitioning the network into anonymizing cliques. Adversaries able to monitor all network traffic cannot deduce the identity of a sender or receiver beyond an anonymizing clique. In addition to strong anonymity, Herbivore simultaneously provides high efficiency and scalability, distinguishing it from other anonymous communication protocols. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that the system can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet.},

  Abstract                 = {Dining cryptographers networks (or DC-nets) are a privacypreserving primitive devised by Chaum for anonymous message publication. A very attractive feature of the basic DC-net is its non-interactivity. Subsequent to key establishment, players may publish their messages in a single broadcast round, with no player-to-player communication. This feature is not possible in other privacy-preserving tools like mixnets. A drawback to DC-nets, however, is that malicious players can easily jam them, i.e., corrupt or block the transmission of messages from honest parties, and may do so without being traced. 
Several researchers have proposed valuable methods of detecting cheating players in DC-nets. This is usually at the cost, however, of multiple broadcast rounds, even in the optimistic case, and often of high computational and/or communications overhead, particularly for fault recovery. We present new DC-net constructions that simultaneously achieve noninteractivity and high-probability detection and identification of cheating players. Our proposals are quite effcient, imposing a basic cost that is linear in the number of participating players. Moreover, even in the case of cheating in our proposed system, just one additional broadcast round suffces for full fault recovery. Among other tools, our constructions employ bilinear maps, a recently popular cryptographic technique for reducing communication complexity.},

NTRU encryption and decryption use a mixing system suggested by polynomial algebra combined with a clustering principle based on elementary probability theory. The security of the NTRU cryptosystem comes from the interaction of the polynomial mixing system with the independence of reduction modulo two relatively prime integers p and q.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to the growing popularity of Tor and other censorship circumvention systems, censors in nondemocratic countries have increased their technical capabilities and can now recognize and block network traffic generated by these systems on a nationwide scale. New censorship-resistant communication systems such as SkypeMorph, StegoTorus, and CensorSpoofer aim to evade censors observations by imitating common protocols like Skype and HTTP.
We demonstrate that these systems completely fail to achieve unobservability. Even a very weak, local censor can easily distinguish their traffic from the imitated protocols. We show dozens of passive and active methods that recognize even a single imitated session, without any need to correlate multiple network flows or perform sophisticated traffic analysis.
We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that unobservability by imitation is a fundamentally flawed approach. We then present our recommendations for the design of unobservable communication systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Information is wealth of any organization and in present era in which information transferred through digital media and internet, it became a top priority for any organizations to protect this wealth. Whatever technique we adopt for the security purpose, the degree and level of security always remains top concern. Steganography is one such technique in which presence of secret message cannot be detected and we can use it as a tool for security purpose to transmit the cofidential information in a secure way. It is an ongoing research area having vast number of applications in distinct fields such as defense and intelligence, medical, on-line banking, on-line transaction, to stop music piracy and other financial and commercial purposes. There are various steganography approaches exist and they differs depending upon message to be embedded, use of file type as carrier or compression method used etc. The focus of this paper is to classify distinct image steganography techniques besides giving overview, importance and challenges of steganography techniques. Other related security techniques are also been discussed in brief in this paper. The classification of steganography techniques may provide not only understanding and guidelines to researchers in this field but also provide directions for future work in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {With widespread acceptance of the Internet as a public medium for communication and information retrieval, there has been rising concern that the personal privacy of users can be eroded by cooperating network entities. A technical solution to maintaining privacy is to provide anonymity. We present a protocol for initiator anonymity called Hordes, which uses forwarding mechanisms similar to those used in previous protocols for sending data, but is the first protocol to make use of multicast routing to anonymously receive data. We show this results in shorter transmission latencies and requires less work of the protocol participants, in terms of the messages processed. We also present a comparison of the security and anonymity of Hordes with previous protocols, using the first quantitative definition of anonymity and unlinkability. Our analysis shows that Hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of Crowds and Onion Routing, but also that Hordes has numerous performance advantages.},

  Abstract                 = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to certain "identifying" attributes. In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called l-diversity. In addition to building a formal foundation for l-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that l-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze information leaks in the lookup mechanisms of structured peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems and how these leaks can be used to compromise anonymity. We show that the techniques that are used to combat active attacks on the lookup mechanism dramatically increase information leaks and increase the eicacy of passive attacks. Thus there is a trade-o between robustness to active and passive attacks. 
We study this trade-o in two P2P anonymous systems, Salsa and AP3. In both cases, we find that, by combining both passive and active attacks, anonymity can be compromised much more eectively than previously thought, rendering these systems insecure for most proposed uses. Our results hold even if security parameters are changed or other improvements to the systems are considered. Our study therefore motivates the search for new approaches to P2P anonymous communication.},

However, one hop in the overlay network can consist of multiple Internet Protocol (IP) hops. Therefore, the length of the overlay multi-hop path must be reduced in order to maintain a good balance between the cost and the benefit provided by the anonymity facility. Unfortunately, the simple Time-To-Live (TTL) algorithm cannot be directly applied here since its use could reveal valuable information to break anonymity. In this paper, a new mechanism which reduces the length of the overlay multi-hop paths is presented. The anonymity level is evaluated by means of simulation and good results are reported},

  Abstract                 = {The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain "identifying" attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. 

In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.},

The coding technique itself, however, is not as well-known. To the coding theorist, this technique is a straightforward extension to a basic coding paradigm and needs no special mention. However, to the systems programmer with no training in coding theory, the technique may be a mystery. Currently, there are no references that describe how to perform this coding that do not assume that the reader is already well-versed in algebra and coding theory. 
This paper is intended for the systems programmer. It presents a complete specification of the coding algorithm plus details on how it may be implemented. This specification assumes no prior knowledge of algebra or coding theory. The goal of this paper is for a systems programmer to be able to implement Reed-Solomon coding for reliability in RAID-like systems without needing to consult any external references.},

This model predicts that anonymity can increase social influence if a common group identity is salient. In a first study, group members were primed with a certain type of social behavior (efficiency vs. prosocial norms). Consistent with the model, anonymous groups displayed prime-consistent behavior in their task solutions, whereas identifiable groups did not. This suggests that the primed norm took root in anonymous groups to a greater extent than in identifiable groups. A second study replicated this effect and showed that nonprimed group members conformed to the behavior of primed members, but only when anonymous, suggesting that the primed norm was socially transmitted within the group. Implications for social influence in small groups are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple scheme for dispersal and recovery of digital information based on the discrete Fourier transform is discussed. The author presents a different implementation of M.O. Rabin's (J. ACM, vol.36, no.2, p.335-48, Apr. 1989) scheme, whose recovery cost is O(log m+k) operations per character, assuming m= Theta (n); for example, when k= Theta (log n), this cost drops from O(m) to O(log m) per character. Since the implementation is based on the Fourier transform, it is termed holographic.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional mix-based systems are composed of a small set of static, well known, and highly reliable mixes. To resist traffic analysis attacks at a mix, cover traffic must be used, which results in significant bandwidth overhead. End-to-end traffic analysis attacks are even more difficult to counter because there are only a few entry-and exit-points in the system. Static mix networks also suffer from scalability problems and in several countries, institutions operating a mix could be targeted by legal attacks. In this paper, we introduce MorphMix, a system for peer-to-peer based anonymous Internet usage. Each MorphMix node is a mix and anyone can easily join the system. We believe that MorphMix overcomes or reduces several drawbacks of static mix networks. In particular, we argue that our approach offers good protection from traffic analysis attacks without employing cover traffic. But MorphMix also introduces new challenges. One is that an adversary can easily operate several malicious nodes in the system and try to break the anonymity of legitimate users by getting full control over their anonymous paths. To counter this attack, we have developed a collusion detection mechanism, which allows to identify compromised paths with high probability before they are being used.},

  abstract   = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be "signed" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic funds transfer" systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a dierent, secret, power d is used, where e * d ? 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the diiculty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet anonymity systems, like for instance Tor, are in widespread use today. Technically they are realized as overlays, i. e., they add another instance of routing, forwarding, and transport functionality on top of the Internet protocol stack. This has important (and often subtle) implications, as overlay and underlay may interact. Far too often, existing designs neglect this. Consequently, they suffer from performance issues that are hard to track down and fix. The existing body of work in this area often takes a quite narrow view, tweaking the design in order to improve one specific aspect. The behavior of the interacting underlay and overlay transport layers is complex, though, and often causes unexpected-and unexplored-side effects. Therefore, we show that so far considered combinations of overlay and underlay protocols cannot deliver good throughput, latency, and fairness at the same time, and we establish guidelines for a future, better suited transport layer design.},

The untraceability of the senders is proved to be unconditional, but that of the recipients implicitly assumes a reliable broadcast network. This assumption is unrealistic in some networks, but it can be removed completely by using the fail-stop key generation schemes by WAIDNER (these proceedings). In both cases, however, each participant can untraceably and permanently disrupt the entire DC-net.},

  abstract  = {Due to the intense competition and low switching cost, building user loyalty is critical for mobile instant messaging (IM) service providers. Integrating both perspectives of network externalities and flow experience, this research identified the factors affecting mobile IM user loyalty. Network externalities include referent network size and perceived complementarity. Flow experience includes perceived enjoyment and attention focus. We conducted data analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that both network externalities and flow experience significantly affect perceived usefulness and satisfaction, further determining user loyalty. Thus mobile service providers need to improve their IM platforms, and deliver positive network externalities and good usage experience to users. Then they can facilitate users loyalty.},

  comment      = {The data in this edition of the Global Internet Phenomena Report is drawn from Sandvine’s installed base of over 160 Tier 1 and Tier 2 fixed, mobile, and WiFi operators worldwide. The report does not include significant data from either China or India, but the data represents a portion of Sandvine\’s 2.5B subscribers installed base, a statistically significant segment of the internet population. 

This edition combines fixed and mobile data into a single comprehensive view of internet traffic across all network types. The volume of traffic on the internet is dominated by fixed line networks, so even though this report includes mobile and WiFi data, the trends on fixed networks dominate traffic share. Within each section, Sandvine measured the global traffic share for applications from several different perspectives:

Downstream: this is the traffic volume downloaded from the internet. Examples would be a video stream, a file download, or an app download from the iTunes store. 

Upstream: this is the traffic volume uploaded to the Internet. It could be requests for content, an interactive messaging session, or a Twitch stream of a gaming session from a console.

Connections: this represents the number of conversations occurring for an application. Some applications use a single connection for all traffic, others use many connections to transfer data or video to the end user.},

  abstract  = {Private messaging over the Internet has proven challenging toimplement, because even if message data is encrypted, it isdifficult to hide metadata aboutwhois communicating in theface of traffic analysis. Systems that offer strong privacy guar-antees, such as Dissent [36], scale to only several thousandclients, because they use techniques with superlinear cost inthe number of clients (e.g., each client broadcasts their mes-sage to all other clients). On the other hand, scalable systems,such as Tor, do not protect against traffic analysis, makingthem ineffective in an era of pervasive network monitoring.Vuvuzela is a new scalable messaging system that offersstrong privacy guarantees, hiding both message data and meta-data. Vuvuzela is secure against adversaries that observe andtamper with all network traffic, and that control all nodes ex-cept for one server.  Vuvuzela’s key insight is to minimizethe number of variables observable by an attacker, and to usedifferential privacy techniques to add noise to all observablevariables in a way that provably hides information about whichusers are communicating.  Vuvuzela has a linear cost in thenumber of clients, and experiments show that it can achieve athroughput of 68,000 messages per second for 1 million userswith a 37-second end-to-end latency on commodity servers.},
