<h1>What is it?</h1> 

<p> 
  <img src="/images/MessageVortexLogo_big.png" style="float:right;max-width:200px;min-width:30%;background-color:#fff;border: 2px solid black;"/> 
  MessageVortex is a protocol which is aimed to maintain the
  anonymity of sender and recipient of a message towards third parties. In
  academia, this concept is called unlinkability. Unlike other protocols, it does
  not provide its transport protocol. Instead, it hides in common transport
  facilities such as email (SMTP/IMAP) or chat (XMPP).

</p>

<p> 
  The protocol does provide the unlinkability by chucking the original message
  into pieces. Then it is passed from node to node. On each node, we apply
  operations very similar to the ones used in fault-tolerant disk systems. Any
  VortexMessage no matter how big or small may carry parts or the full message. In
  one routing node (the recipient) the message is assembled and thus readable for
  the recipient. We refer the whole routing process onionized mixing. 
  &quot;Mixing&quot; is  not entirely accurate as the protocol does more. It adds 
  redundancy information to the protocol while sending the message in chunks. This 
  redundancy makes it next to impossible for someone to follow the message flow. 
</p>

<h1 style="float:clear;">Why should we use just another protocol?</h1>
<p>
  What is so special about the protocol you might ask. First, it has some unique 
  properties because it hides within other protocols. Therefore, all "ordinary 
  users" of the protocol do improve hiding as they increase the mass to be analyzed. 
  Another unique property is that it relays not on any trust into a central 
  infrastructure. In fact, we assume malicious nodes. Third, any message 
  transferring account may be used to send VortexMessages. No need to build 
  specialized servers. A smartphone or an ordinary PC can do it.

<h1>Where should I start?</h1>
<p>
  Currently published is only the draft of the RFC document some academic work and 
  an executable binary. If you are interested in the projects source code, feel free 
  to contact the website owner. It should be released, but at this point, the code 
  is still in desperate need of some massaging. There is already a working (but not 
  yet complete) implementation for academic experiments available.
</p>

<p>
  Just give it a try.
</p>
<p>
  Until the end user version is released, feel free to read the RFC draft or the 
  other docs. They are becoming more and more stable. The protocol may be considered 
  as final.
