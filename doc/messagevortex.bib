  Abstract                 = {Informally, a communication protocol is sender k - anonymous if it can guarantee that anadversary, trying to determine the sender of a particular message, can only narrow down itssearch to a set of k suspects. Receiver k-anonymity places a similar guarantee on the receiver:an adversary, at best, can only narrow down the possible receivers to a set of size k. In this paperwe introduce the notions of sender and receiver k-anonymity and consider their applications.We show that there exist simple and efficient protocols which are k-anonymous for both thesender and the receiver in a model where a polynomial time adversary can see all traffic in thenetwork and can control up to a constant fraction of the participants. Our protocol is provablysecure, practical, and does not require the existence of trusted third parties. This paper alsoprovides a conceptually simple augmentation to Chaum’s DC-Nets that adds robustness againstadversaries who attempt to disrupt the protocol through perpetual transmission or selectivenon-participation.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymity is considered as a valuable property as far as everyday transactions in the Internet are concerned. Users care about their privacy and they seek for new ways to keep secret as much as of their personal information from third parties. Anonymizing systems exist nowadays that provide users with the technology, which is able to hide their origin when they use applications such as the World Wide Web or Instant Messaging. However, all these systems are vulnerable to a number of attacks and some of them may collapse under a low strength adversary. In this paper we explore anonymity from a di®erent perspective. Instead of building a new anonymizing system, we try to overload an existing file sharing system, Gnutella, and use it for a di®erent purpose. We develop a technique that transforms Gnutella as an Anonymizing System (GAS) for a single download from the World Wide Web.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor has become one of the most popular overlay networks for anonymizing TCP traffic. Its popularity is due in part to its perceived strong anonymity properties and its relatively low latency service. Low latency is achieved through Tor's ability to balance the traffic load by optimizing Tor router selection to probabilistically favor routers with highbandwidth capabilities.

We investigate how Tor's routing optimizations impact its ability to provide strong anonymity. Through experiments conducted on PlanetLab, we show the extent to which routing performance optimizations have left the system vulnerable to end-to-end traffic analysis attacks from non-global adversaries with minimal resources. Further, we demonstrate that entry guards, added to mitigate path disruption attacks, are themselves vulnerable to attack. Finally, we explore solutions to improve Tor's current routing algorithms and propose alternative routing strategies that prevent some of the routing attacks used in our experiments.},

The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.},

The technique does not require a universally trusted authority. One correspondent can remain anonymous to a second, while allowing the second to respond via an untraceable return address.
The technique can also be used to form rosters of untraceable digital pseudonyms from selected applications. Applicants retain the exclusive ability to form digital signatures corresponding to their pseudonyms. Elections in which any interested party can verify that the ballots have been properly counted are possible if anonymously mailed ballots are signed with pseudonyms from a roster of registered voters. Another use allows an individual to correspond witha record-keeping organization under a unique pseudonym which appears in a roster of acceptable clients.},

  Abstract                 = {In Year 2005, Internet users were twice more likely to receive unsolicited electronic messages, known as spams, than regular emails. Proof of work protocols are designed to deter such phenomena and other denial-of-service attacks by requiring computed stamps based on hard-to-solve problems with easy-to-verify solutions. As cpu-intensive computations are badly hit over time by Moore's law, memory-bound computations have been suggested to deal with heterogeneous hardware. We introduce new practical, optimal, proven and possibly memory-bound functions suitable to these protocols, in which the client-side work to compute the response is intrinsically exponential with respect to the server-side work needed to set or check the challenge. One-way non-interactive solution-verification variants are also presented. Although simple implementations of such functions are bound by memory latency, optimized versions are shown to be bound by memory bandwidth instead.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the security requirements for creating a Deniable File System (DFS), and the efficacy with which the TrueCrypt disk-encryption software meets those requirements. We find that the Windows Vista operating system itself, Microsoft Word, and Google Desktop all compromise the deniability of a TrueCrypt DFS. While staged in the context of TrueCrypt, our research highlights several fundamental challenges to the creation and use of any DFS: even when the file system may be deniable in the pure, mathematical sense, we find that the environment surrounding that file system can undermine its deniability, as well as its contents. We hypothesize some extensions of our discoveries to regular (non-deniable) encrypted file systems. Finally, we suggest approaches for overcoming these challenges on modern operating systems like Windows. We analyzed TrueCrypt version 5.1a (latest available version during the writing of the paper); Truecrypt v6 introduces new features, including the ability to create deniable operating systems, which we have not studied.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2005, Murdoch and Danezis demonstrated the first practical congestion attack against a deployed anonymity network. They could identify which relays were on a target Tor user’s path by building paths one at a time through every Tor relay and introducing congestion. However, the original attack was performed on only 13 Tor relays on the nascent and lightly loaded Tor network. We show that the attack from their paper is no longer practical on today’s 1500-relay heavily loaded Tor network. The attack doesn’t scale because a) the attacker needs a tremendous amount of bandwidth to measure enough relays during the attack window, and b) there are too many false positives now that many other users are adding congestion at the same time as the attacks. We then strengthen the original congestion attack by combining it with a novel bandwidth amplification attack based on a flaw in the Tor design that lets us build long circuits that loop back on themselves. We show that this new combination attack is practical and effective by demonstrating a working attack on today’s deployed Tor network. By coming up with a model to better understand Tor’s routing behavior under congestion, we further provide a statistical analysis characterizing how effective our attack is in each case.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether it is port scans, spam, or distributed denial-of-service attacks from botnets, unwanted traffic is a fundamental problem in all networked systems. Although proof-of-work has been proposed as a mechanism for thwarting such attacks, few proof-of-work systems have been successfully deployed. One of the problems in the proof-of-work approach is that the systems that issue and verify puzzles are typically located at or near the server edge. Rather than eliminate the denial-of-service problem, such approaches merely shift the problem from the service itself to the proof-of-work systems protecting the service. As a result, adversaries can disable services by flooding the issuer, by flooding the verifier, or by flooding all of the network links that lead to the issuer and verifier. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new approach for building proof-of-work systems based on publicly verifiable client puzzles. The system works by issuing a single "public work function" that clients must solve for each of its subsequent requests. Because the work function is publicly verifiable, any network device at the client's edge can verify that subsequent traffic will be accepted by the service. The system mitigates floods to the issuer since only a single work function needs to be given per client, thus allowing duplicate requests and replies to be supressed. The system mitigates floods to the verifier and across links leading to the server edge by allowing the verifier to be placed arbitrarily close to the client adversary.},

  Abstract                 = {Client puzzles have been proposed in a number of protocols as a mechanism for mitigating the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.},

  Abstract                 = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to certain "identifying" attributes. In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called l-diversity. In addition to building a formal foundation for l-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that l-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

  Abstract                 = {The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain "identifying" attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. 

In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well-known that Reed-Solomon codes may be used to provide error correction for multiple failures in RAID-like systems. The coding technique itself, however, is not as well-known. To the coding theorist, this technique is a straightforward extension to a basic coding paradigm and needs no special mention. However, to the systems programmer with no training in coding theory, the technique may be a mystery. Currently, there are no references that describe how to perform this coding that do not assume that the reader is already well-versed in algebra and coding theory. 
This paper is intended for the systems programmer. It presents a complete specification of the coding algorithm plus details on how it may be implemented. This specification assumes no prior knowledge of algebra or coding theory. The goal of this paper is for a systems programmer to be able to implement Reed-Solomon coding for reliability in RAID-like systems without needing to consult any external references.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1997, SPE published a tutorial by Plank on implementing Reed-Solomon codes for erasure correction in redundant data storage systems. The motivation of this tutorial was to present these codes, which are typically described mathematically by coding theorists, in a way accessible to the programmers who need to implement them. The tutorial as published presented an information dispersal matrix A, which does not have the properties claimed -- that the deletion of any m rows results in an invertable n*n matrix. The purpose of this note is to present a correct information dispersal matrix that has the desired properties, and to put the work in current context.},

  Abstract                 = {Two studies examined hypotheses derived from a Social Identity model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) as applied to social influence in computer-mediated communication (CMC) in groups. This model predicts that anonymity can increase social influence if a common group identity is salient. In a first study, group members were primed with a certain type of social behavior (efficiency vs. prosocial norms). Consistent with the model, anonymous groups displayed prime-consistent behavior in their task solutions, whereas identifiable groups did not. This suggests that the primed norm took root in anonymous groups to a greater extent than in identifiable groups. A second study replicated this effect and showed that nonprimed group members conformed to the behavior of primed members, but only when anonymous, suggesting that the primed norm was socially transmitted within the group. Implications for social influence in small groups are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet anonymity systems, like for instance Tor, are in widespread use today. Technically they are realized as overlays, i. e., they add another instance of routing, forwarding, and transport functionality on top of the Internet protocol stack. This has important (and often subtle) implications, as overlay and underlay may interact. Far too often, existing designs neglect this. Consequently, they suffer from performance issues that are hard to track down and fix. The existing body of work in this area often takes a quite narrow view, tweaking the design in order to improve one specific aspect. The behavior of the interacting underlay and overlay transport layers is complex, though, and often causes unexpected-and unexplored-side effects. Therefore, we show that so far considered combinations of overlay and underlay protocols cannot deliver good throughput, latency, and fairness at the same time, and we establish guidelines for a future, better suited transport layer design.},
