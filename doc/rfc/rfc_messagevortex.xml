            <t>
                MessageVortex Protocol specifies messages that may be embedded into existing message transfer protocols such
                as SMTP or XMPP in order to send them anonymously from peer to peer.
            </t>
            <t>
                The protocol outperforms other protocols by completely decoupling transport from the final transmitter and
                receiver party. There is no trust put into any infrastructure except for the infrastructure of the sending
                and receiving party of a message. Message flow is entirely selected by the creator of the routing block.
                Participating routing nodes gain no unobvious knowledge about messages even when collaborating. Third party
                anonymity may be always achieved. Furthermore one out of sender, and receiver anonymity may be achieved as
                well.
