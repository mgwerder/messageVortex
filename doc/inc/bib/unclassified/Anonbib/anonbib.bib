  Abstract                 = {In this paper we demonstrate how to reduce the overhead and delay of circuit establishment in the Tor anonymizing network by using predistributed Diffie-Hellman values. We eliminate the use of RSA encryption and decryption from circuit setup, and we reduce the number of DH exponentiations vs. the current Tor circuit setup protocol while maintaining immediate forward secrecy. We also describe savings that can be obtained by precomputing during idle cycles values that can be determined before the protocol starts. We introduce the distinction of eventual vs. immediate forward secrecy and present protocols that illustrate the distinction. These protocols are even more efficient in communication and computation than the one we primarily propose, but they provide only eventual forward secrecy. We describe how to reduce the overhead and the complexity of hidden server connections by using our DH-values to implement valet nodes and eliminate the need for rendezvous points as they exist today. We also discuss the security of the new elements and an analysis of efficiency improvements.},

  Abstract                 = {Location hidden services have received increasing attention as a means to resist censorship and protect the identity of service operators. Research and vulnerability analysis to date has mainly focused on how to locate the hidden service. But while the hiding techniques have improved, almost no progress has been made in increasing the resistance against DoS attacks directly or indirectly on hidden services. In this paper we suggest improvements that should be easy to adopt with in the existing hidden service design, improvements that will bot h reduce vulnerability to DoS attacks and add QoS as a service option. In addition we show how to hide not just the location but the existence of the hidden service from everyone but the users knowing its service address. Not even the public directory servers will know how a private hidden service can be contacted, or know it exists.},

  Abstract                 = {Hidden services were deployed on the Tor anonymous communication network in 2004. Announced properties include server resistance to distributed DoS. Both the EFF and Reporters Without Borders have issued guides that describe using hidden services via Tor to protect the safety of dissidents as well as to resist censorship. We present fast and cheap attacks that reveal the location of a hidden server. Using a single hostile Tor node we have located deployed hidden servers in a matter of minutes. Although we examine hidden services over Tor, our results apply to any client using a variety of anonymity networks. In fact, these are the first actual intersection attacks on any deployed public network: thus confirming general expectations from prior theory and simulation.
We recommend changes to route selection design and implementation for Tor. These changes require no operational increase in network overhead and are simple to make; but they prevent the attacks we have demonstrated. They have been implemented.},

Here we explore some reasons why anonymity systems are particularly hard to deploy, enumerate the incentives to participate either as senders or also as nodes, and build a general model to describe the effects of these incentives. We then describe and justify some simplifying assumptions to make the model manageable, and compare optimal strategies for participants based on a variety of scenarios.},

Both allow efficient distributed verifiable decryption.
Finally, we give a distributed protocol for sampling and obfuscating each of the above shuffles and show how it can be used in a trivial way to construct a universally composable mix-net.

We construct a decryption shuffle from any additively homomorphic cryptosystem and show how it can be public-key obfuscated. This construction does not allow efficient distributed verifiable decryption. Then we show how to public-key obfuscate: a decryption shuffle based on the Boneh-Goh-Nissim (BGN) cryptosystem, and a re-encryption shuffle based on the Paillier cryptosystem. Both constructions allow \emph{efficient} distributed verifiable decryption. In the Paillier case we identify and exploit a previously overlooked ``homomorphic'' property of the cryptosystem.

Finally, we give a distributed protocol for sampling and obfuscating each of the above shuffles and show how it can be used in a trivial way to construct a universally composable mix-net. Our constructions are practical when the number of senders $N$ is reasonably small, e.g. $N=350$ in the BGN case and $N=2000$ in the Paillier case.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of anonymity providing techniques is to preserve the privacy of users, who has communicated with whom, for how long, and from which location, by hiding traffic information. This is accomplished by organizing additional traffic to conceal particular communication relationships and by embedding the sender and receiver of a message in their respective anonymity sets. If the number of overall participants is greater than the size of the anonymity set and if the anonymity set changes with time due to unsynchronized participants, then the anonymity technique becomes prone to traffic analysis attacks. We are interested in the statistical properties of the disclosure attack, a newly suggested traffic analysis attack on the MIXes. Our goal is to provide analytical estimates of the number of observations required by the disclosure attack and to identify fundamental (but avoidable) 'weak operational modes' of the MIXes and thus to protect users against a traffic analysis by the disclosure attack.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymous authentication can give users the license to misbehave since there is no fear of retribution. As a deterrent, or means to revocation, various schemes for accountable anonymity feature some kind of (possibly distributed) trusted third party (TTP) with the power to identify or link misbehaving users. Recently, schemes such as BLAC and PEREA showed how anonymous revocation can be achieved without such TTPsâ€”anonymous users can be revoked if they misbehave, and yet nobody can identify or link such users cryptographically. Despite being the state of the art in anonymous revocation, these schemes allow only a basic form of revocation amounting to â€˜revoke anybody with d or more misbehaviorsâ€™ or â€˜revoke anybody whose combined misbehavior score is too highâ€™ (where misbehaviors are assigned a â€˜severityâ€™ score). We present BLACR, which significantly advances anonymous revocation in three ways: 1) It constitutes a first attempt to generalize reputation-based anonymous revocation, where negative or positive scores can be assigned to anonymous sessions across multiple categories. Servers can block users based on policies, which specify a boolean combination of reputations in these categories; 2) We present a weighted extension, which allows the total severity score to ramp up for multiple misbehaviors by the same user; and, 3) We make a significant improvement in authentication times through a technique we call express lane authentication, which makes reputation-based anonymous revocation practical.},

On the other hand, we look at PipeNet, a simple theoretical model which protects against the traffic analysis attacks we point out, but is vulnerable to denial of services attacks and has efficiency problems. In light of these observations, we discuss the trade-offs that one faces when trying to construct an efficient low latency communication system that protects users anonymity.},

  Abstract                 = {We present BitBlender, an efficient protocol that provides an anonymity layer for BitTorrent traffic. BitBlender works by creating an ad-hoc multi-hop network consisting of special peers calledâ€œrelay peersâ€? that proxy requests and replies on behalf of other peers. To understand the effect of introducing relay peers into the BitTorrent system architecture, we provide an analysis of the expected path lengths as the ratio of relay peers to normal peers varies. A prototype is implemented and experiments are conducted on Planetlab to quantify the performance overhead associated with the protocol. We also propose protocol extensions to add confidentiality and access control mechanisms, countermeasures against traffic analysis attacks, and selective caching policies that simultaneously increase both anonymity and performance. We finally discuss the potential legal obstacles to deploying an anonymous file sharing protocol. This work is among the first to propose a privacy enhancing system that is designed specifically for a particular class of peer-to-peer traffic.},

Existing methods for studying Tor have included analytical modeling, simulations, small-scale network emulations, small-scale PlanetLab deployments, and measurement and analysis of the live Tor network. Despite the growing body of work concerning Tor, there is no widely accepted methodology for conducting Tor research in a manner that preserves realism while protecting live usersâ€™ privacy. In an effort to propose a standard, rigorous experimental framework for conducting Tor research in a way that ensures safety and realism, we present the design of ExperimenTor, a largescale Tor network emulation toolkit and testbed. We also report our early experiences with prototype testbeds currently deployed at four research institutions.},

  Abstract                 = {This work develops a novel approach to hide the senders and the receivers of messages. The intuition is taken from an everyday activity that hides the ``communication pattern''â€”the public transportation system. To describe our protocols, buses are used as a metaphor: Buses, i.e., messages, are traveling on the network, each piece of information is allocated a seat within the bus. Routes are chosen and buses are scheduled to traverse these routes. Deterministic and randomized protocols are presented, the protocols differ in the number of buses in the system, the worst case traveling time, and the required buffer size in a ``station.'' In particular, a protocol that is based on cluster partition of the network is presented; in this protocol there is one bus traversing each cluster. The clusters' size in the partition gives time and communication tradeoffs. One advantage of our protocols over previous works is that they are not based on statistical properties for the communication pattern. Another advantage is that they only require the processors in the communication network to be busy periodically.},

  Abstract                 = {A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being retrieved. In a t-private, k-server PIR protocol the database is replicated among k servers, and the userâ€™s privacy is protected from any collusion of up to t servers. The main cost-measure of such protocols is the communication complexity of retrieving a single bit of data. This work addresses the information-theoretic setting for PIR, in which the userâ€™s privacy should be unconditionally protected from collusions of servers. We present a unified general construction, whose abstract components can be instantiated to yield both old and new families of PIR protocols. A main ingredient in the new protocols is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam to a communication complexity problem in the so-called simultaneous messages model.
Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and resolves some previous anomalies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t-private k-server PIR protocols with communication O(n1/b(2kâˆ’1)/tc), where n is the database size. For t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic improvement over the previous state of the art; (2) a constant-factor improvement in the communication complexity of 1-private PIR, providing the first improvement to the 2-server case since PIR protocols were introduced; (3) efficient PIR protocols with logarithmic query length. The latter protocols have applications to the construction of efficient families of locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR protocols with reduced work by the servers.},

  Abstract                 = {Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user to retrieve a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being retrieved. Specifically, in information-theoretic, k-server PIR protocols the database is replicated among k servers, and each server learns nothing about the item the user retrieves. The cost of such protocols is measured by the communication complexity of retrieving one out of n bits of data. For any fixed k, the complexity of the best protocols prior to our work was O(n^(1/(2k-1)) (Ambainis, 1997). Since then several methods were developed in an attempt to beat this bound, but all these methods yielded the same asymptotic bound.
In this work, this barrier is finally broken and the complexity of information-theoretic k-server PIR is improved to n^O( (log log k)/(k log k) ). The new PIR protocols can also be used to construct k-query binary locally decodable codes of length exp(n^O( (log log k)/(k log k) )), compared to exp(n^(1/(k-1)) in previous constructions. The improvements presented in this paper apply even for small values of k: the PIR protocols are more efficient than previous ones for every k >= 3, and the locally decodable codes are shorter for every k >= 4.},

  Abstract                 = {A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a user to retrieve a data item of its choice from a database, such that the servers storing the database do not gain information on the identity of the item being retrieved. PIR protocols were studied in depth since the subject was introduced in Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan 1995. The standard definition of PIR protocols raises a simple question â€“ what happens if some of the servers crash during the operation? How can we devise a protocol which still works in the presence of crashing servers? Current systems do not guarantee availability of servers at all times for many reasons, e.g., crash of server or communication problems. Our purpose is to design robust PIR protocols, i.e., protocols which still work correctly even if only k out of ` servers are available during the protocolsâ€™ operation (the user does not know in advance which servers are available).

We present various robust PIR protocols giving different tradeoffs between the different parameters. These protocols are incomparable, i.e., for different values of n and k we will get better results using different protocols. We first present a generic transformation from regular PIR protocols to robust PIR protocols, this transformation is important since any improvement in the communication complexity of regular PIR protocol will immediately implicate improvement in the robust PIR protocol communication. We also present two specific robust PIR protocols. Finally, we present robust PIR protocols which can tolerate Byzantine servers, i.e., robust PIR protocols which still work in the presence of malicious servers or servers with corrupted or obsolete databases.},

The main focus of this work is gap, a simple protocol for anonymous transfer of data which can achieve better anonymity guarantees than many traditional indirection schemes and is additionally more efficient. gap is based on a new perspective on how to achieve anonymity. Based on this new perspective it is possible to relax the requirements stated in traditional indirection schemes, allowing individual nodes to balance anonymity with efficiency according to their specific needs.},

  Abstract                 = {Chaum [1, 2] suggested a simple and efficient protocol aimed at providing anonymity in the presence of an adversary watching all communication links. Chaumâ€™s protocol is known to be insecure. We show that Chaumâ€™s protocol becomes secure when the attack model is relaxed and the adversary can control at most 99% of communication links.

Our proof technique is markedly different than previous work. We establish a connection with information theory - a connection we believe is useful also elsewhere, and which we believe supplies the correct language to attack the problem. We introduce â€œobscurant networksâ€? - networks that can obscure the destination of each particular player, and we show almost all executions of the protocol include such a network. The security guarantee we supply is very strong. It shows the adversary learns almost no information about any subset of players. Remarkably, we show that this guarantee holds even if the adversary has a-priori information about communication patters (e.g., people tend to speak less with those who do not understand their language). We believe this is an important issue in the real world and is a desirable property any anonymous system should have.},

The advantages and disadvantages in respect to the freedom of choice are presented and examined. Weâ€™ll show that some additional attacks are possible in networks with freely chosen MIX routes. After describing these attacks, we estimate their impact on the achievable degree of anonymity. Finally, we evaluate the relevance of the described attacks with respect to existing systems like e.g. Mixmaster, Crowds, and Freedom.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymous channels are necessary for a multitude of privacy-protecting protocols. Onion routing is probably the best known way to achieve anonymity in practice. However, the cryptographic aspects of onion routing have not been sufficiently explored: no satisfactory definitions of security have been given, and existing constructions have only had ad-hoc security analysis for the most part. We provide a formal definition of onion-routing in the universally composable framework, and also discover a simpler definition (similar to CCA2 security for encryption) that implies security in the UC framework. We then exhibit an efficient and easy to implement construction of an onion routing scheme satisfying this definition.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption. These results are a generalization of the anonymous credential system of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we put forward a new onion routing protocol which achieves forward secrecy in a fully non-interactive fashion, without requiring any communication from the router and/or the users and the service provider to update time-related keys. We compare this to TOR which requires O(n2) rounds of interaction to establish a circuit of size n. In terms of the computational effort required to the parties, our protocol is comparable to TOR, but the network latency associated with TORâ€™s high round complexity ends up dominating the running time. Compared to other recently proposed alternative to TOR (such as the PB-OR and CL-OR protocols) our scheme still has the advantage of being non-interactive (both PB-OR and CL-OR require some interaction to update time-sensitive information), and achieves similar computational performances. We performed extensive implementation and simulation tests that confirm our theoretical analysis. Additionally, while comparing our scheme to PB-OR, we discovered a flaw in the security of that scheme which we repair in this paper. Our solution is based on the application of forward-secure encryption. We design a forward-secure encryption scheme (of independent interest) to be used as the main encryption scheme in an onion routing protocol.},

  Abstract                 = {Randomized protocols for hiding private information can be regarded as noisy channels in the information-theoretic sense, and the inference of the concealed information can be regarded as a hypothesis-testing problem. We consider the Bayesian approach to the problem, and investigate the probability of error associated to the MAP (Maximum Aposteriori Probability) inference rule. Our main result is a constructive characterization of a convex base of the probability of error, which allows us to compute its maximum value (over all possible input distributions), and to identify upper bounds for it in terms of simple functions. As a side result, we are able to improve the Hellman-Raviv and the Santhi-Vardy bounds expressed in terms of conditional entropy. We then discuss an application of our methodology to the Crowds protocol, and in particular we show how to compute the bounds on the probability that an adversary break anonymity.},

However, because the original packets are passed through the firewall unscathed, if the endpoints completely ignore the firewallâ€™s resets, then the connection will proceed unhindered. Once one connection has been blocked, the firewall makes further easy-to-evade attempts to block further connections from the same machine. This latter behaviour can be leveraged into a denial-of-service attack on third-party machines.},

  Abstract                 = {Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to disrupt the groupâ€™s communication. Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks,Mixnets are difficult to protect against traffic analysis, and accountable voting protocols are unsuited to general anonymous messaging. We present the first general messaging protocol that offers provable anonymity with accountability for moderate-size groups, and efficiently handles unbalanced loads where few members wish to transmit in a given round. The N group members first cooperatively shuffle an N Ã— N matrix of pseudorandom seeds, then use these seeds in N â€œpre-plannedâ€? DC-nets protocol runs. Each DCnets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one memberâ€™s message, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity under our attack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and one-to-one correspondence between members and messages, makes denial-of-service attacks by members traceable to the culprit, and efficiently handles large, unbalanced message loads. A working prototype demonstrates the protocolâ€™s practicality for anonymousmessaging in groups of 40+members.},

We prove that such a topology is eÂ±cient since it only requires the route length of messages to be relatively small in comparison with the number of mixes to achieve maximal anonymity. Additionally mixes can resist intersection attacks while their batch size, that is directly linked to the latency of the network, remains constant. A worked example of a network is also presented to illustrate how these results can be applied to create secure mix networks in practise.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis contributes to the field of anonymous communications over widely deployed communication networks. It describes novel schemes to protect anonymity; it also presents powerful new attacks and new ways of analysing and understanding anonymity properties. We present Mixminion, a new generation anonymous remailer, and examine its security against all known passive and active cryptographic attacks. We use the secure anonymous replies it provides, to describe a pseudonym server, as an example of the anonymous protocols that mixminion can support. The security of mix systems is then assessed against a compulsion threat model, in which an adversary can request the decryption of material from honest nodes. A new construction, the fs-mix, is presented that makes tracing messages by such an adversary extremely expensive.
Moving beyond the static security of anonymous communication protocols, we define a metric based on information theory that can be used to measure anonymity. The analysis of the pool mix serves as an example of its use. We then create a framework within which we compare the traffic analysis resistance provided by different mix network topologies. A new topology, based on expander graphs, proves to be eÂ±cient and secure. The rgb-mix is also presented; this implements a strategy to detect flooding attacks against honest mix nodes and neutralise them by the use of cover traffic.
Finally a set of generic attacks are studied. Statistical disclosure attacks model the whole anonymous system as a black box, and are able to uncover the relationships between long-term correspondents. Stream attacks trace streams of data travelling through anonymizing networks, and uncover the communicating parties very quickly. They both use statistical methods to drastically reduce the anonymity of users. Other minor attacks are described against peer discovery and route reconstruction in anonymous networks, as well as the naÂ¨ive use of anonymous replies.},

Possibly corrupt mixes on the message path gain no information about the route length or the position of the mix on the route. Most importantly Minx resists active attackers that are prepared to modify messages in order to embed tags which they will try to detect elsewhere in the network. The proposed scheme imposes a low communication and computational overhead, and only combines well understood cryptographic primitives.},

  Abstract                 = {Mix networks are used to deliver messages anonymously to recipients, but do not straightforwardly allow the recipient of an anonymous message to reply to its sender. Yet the ability to reply one or more times, and to further reply to replies, is essential to a complete anonymous conversation. We propose a protocol that allows a sender of anonymous messages to establish a reusable anonymous return channel. This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply to different messages can not test whether two return channels are the same, and therefore can not learn whether they are replying to the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple replies through the same return channel helps defend against the counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels. In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the same number of messages. Our scheme resists these attacks because the replies sent by an attacker are mixed with other replies submitted by other recipients through the same return channel. Moreover, our protocol straightforwardly allows for replies to replies, etc. Our protocol is based upon a re-encryption mix network, and requires four times the amount of computation and communication of a basic mixnet.},

We then present a statistical disclosure attack that can be used to attack models of anonymous communication networks based on pool mixes. Careful approximations make the attack computationally efficient. Such models are potentially better suited to derive results that could apply to the security of real anonymous communication networks.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents information theoretic anonymity metrics and various analysis of anonymous communication nodes. Our contributions are a step towards the understanding of anonymity properties and the development of robust anonymous communications. Anonymous communications are an essential building block for privacy-enhanced applications, as the data available at the communication layer may leak critical private information.
One of the main contributions of our work is the degree of anonymity, a practical information theoretic anonymity metric. Entropy-based anonymity metrics can be applied to measure the degree of anonymity provided by an anonymous service to its users. In particular, these metrics can be applied to systems which leak probabilistic relationships between the anonymous subjects and their transactions. We present a taxonomy of the two main building blocks used to implement anonymous communication networks, which are anonymous communication nodes (called mixes) and cover traffic policies (called dummy traffic). We propose a model for describing anonymous communication nodes which extends design possibilities and facilitates the analysis of anonymity properties. We identify the parameters which must be taken into account in the design and analysis of mix-based anonymous communication networks.
In order to show the practical applications of information theoretic anonymity metrics, we have applied the metrics to evaluate the anonymity properties of various nodes for anonymous communication which have been proposed in the literature. We analyze the anonymity provided by these nodes when subject to passive and active attacks, while considering scenarios with and without cover traffic techniques.
We have analyzed two working implementations of anonymous email in real traffic conditions. The tools used for the analysis are information theoretic metrics and our model for anonymous communication nodes. We show that anonymous email traffic patterns are hard to predict and no assumptions on them should be made. We find that the two studied designs offer very different tradeoffs for anonymity and performance.
All in all, we believe that information theoretic metrics are a useful tool to characterize anonymity properties. Our work is one step towards a better understanding of anonymity and our results can be used for the design of robust anonymity technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the anonymity provided by two popular email mix implementations, Mixmaster and Reliable, and compare their effectiveness through the use of simulations which model the algorithms used by these mixing applications. Our simulations are based on actual traffic data obtained from a public anonymous remailer (mix node). We determine that assumptions made in previous literature about the distribution of mix input traffic are incorrect: in particular, the input traffic does not follow a Poisson distribution. We establish for the first time that a lower bound exists on the anonymity of Mixmaster, and discover that under certain circumstances the algorithm used by Reliable provides no anonymity. We find that the upper bound on anonymity provided by Mixmaster is slightly higher than that provided by Reliable.

We identify flaws in the software in Reliable that further compromise its ability to provide anonymity, and review key areas that are necessary for the security of a mix in addition to a sound algorithm. Our analysis can be used to evaluate under which circumstances the two mixing algorithms should be used to best achieve anonymity and satisfy their purpose. Our work can also be used as a framework for establishing a security review process for mix node deployments.},

In particular, we call binomial mix a timed pool mix that tosses coins and uses a probability function that depends on the number of messages inside the mix at the time of flushing. We discuss the properties of this mix.},

By combining the user bases into the same network, and ensuring that all traffic is mixed together, we hope to lower delay and improve anonymity for both sets of users.
Alpha-mixing is an approach that can be added to traditional batching strategies to let senders specify for each message whether they prefer security or speed. Here we describe how to add alpha-mixing to various mix designs, and show that mix networks with this feature can provide increased anonymity for all senders in the network. Along the way we encounter subtle issues to do with the attackerâ€™s knowledge of the security parameters of the users.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a MIX cascade protocol and a reputation system that together increase the reliability of a network of MIX cascades. In our protocol, MIX nodes periodically generate a communally random seed that, along with their reputations, determines cascade configuration. Nodes send test messages to monitor their cascades. Senders can also demonstrate message decryptions to convince honest cascade members that a cascade is misbehaving. By allowing any node to declare the failure of its own cascade, we eliminate the need for global trusted witnesses.},

  Abstract                 = {On the Internet it is easy for someone to obtain a new identity. This introduces opportunities to misbehave without paying reputational consequences. A large degree of cooperation can still emerge, through a convention in which newcomers "pay their dues" by accepting poor treatment from players who have established positive reputations. One might hope for an open society where newcomers are treated well, but there is an inherent social cost in making the spread of reputations optional. We prove that no equilibrium can sustain significantly more cooperation than the dues-paying equilibrium in a repeated random matching game with a large number of players in which players have finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there is a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes. Although one could remove the ineciency of mistreating newcomers by disallowing anonymity, this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of transactions. We discuss the use of entry fees, which permits newcomers to be trusted but excludes some players with low payoffs, thus introducing a different inefficiency. We also discuss the use of free but unreplaceable pseudonyms, and describe a mechanism which implements them using standard encryption techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {To explore mission-critical information, an adversary using active traffic analysis attacks injects probing traffic into the victim network and analyzes the status of underlying payload traffic. Active traffic analysis attacks are easy to deploy and hence become a serious threat to mission critical applications. This paper suggests statistical pattern recognition as a fundamental technology to evaluate effectiveness of active traffic analysis attacks and corresponding countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that sample entropy of ping packets' round trip time is an effective feature statistic to discover the payload traffic rate. We propose simple countermeasures that can significantly reduce the effectiveness of ping-based active traffic analysis attacks. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of this scheme, which can also be used in other scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new attack on the anonymity of web browsing with Tor. The attack tricks a userâ€™s web browser into sending a distinctive signal over the Tor network that can be detected using traffic analysis. It is delivered by a malicious exit node using a man-in-the-middle attack on HTTP. Both the attack and the traffic analysis can be performed by an adversary with limited resources. While the attack can only succeed if the attacker controls one of the victimâ€™s entry guards, the method reduces the time required for a traffic analysis attack on Tor from O(nk) to O(n + k), where n is the number of exit nodes and k is the number of entry guards. This paper presents techniques that exploit the Tor exit policy system to greatly simplify the traffic analysis. The fundamental vulnerability exposed by this paper is not specific to Tor but rather to the problem of anonymous web browsing itself. This paper also describes a related attack on users who toggle the use of Tor with the popular Firefox extension Torbutton.},

One of the basic properties of the current electronic communication means is the identi cation of the end-points. However, at times it is desirable or even critical to hide the identity and/or whereabouts of theend-points (e.g., human users) involved.
This paper discusses the goals and desired properties of anonymous email in general and introduces the design and salient features of Babel anonymous remailer. Babel allows email users to converse electronically while remaining anonymous with respect to each other and to other -- even hostile -- parties. A range of attacks and corresponding countermeasures is considered. An attempt is made to formalize and quantify certain dimensions of anonymity and untraceable communication.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to increasingly sophisticated methods of blocking access to censorship circumvention schemes such as Tor, recently proposed systems such as Skypemorph, FreeWave, and Censor-Spoofer have used voice and video conferencing protocols as â€œcover channelsâ€? to hide proxy connections. We demonstrate that even with perfect emulation of the cover channel, these systems can be vulnerable to attacks that detect or disrupt the covert communications while having no effect on legitimate cover traffic. Our attacks stem from differences in the channel requirements for the cover protocols, which are peer-to-peer and loss tolerant, and the covert traffic, which is client-proxy and loss intolerant. These differences represent significant limitations and suggest that such protocols are a poor choice of cover channel for general censorship circumvention schemes.},

In this paper, we describe Herbivore, a peer-to-peer, scalable, tamper-resilient communication system that provides provable anonymity and privacy. Building on dining cryptographer networks, Herbivore scales by partitioning the network into anonymizing cliques. Adversaries able to monitor all network traffic cannot deduce the identity of a sender or receiver beyond an anonymizing clique. In addition to strong anonymity, Herbivore simultaneously provides high efficiency and scalability, distinguishing it from other anonymous communication protocols. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that the system can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an architecture, Onion Routing, that limits a network's vulnerability to traffic analysis. The architecture provides anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers. It provides real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any protocol that can be adapted to use a proxy service. Specifically, the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though no-one but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous and next hops in the communication chain. This implies that neither the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server. A prototype of Onion Routing has been implemented. This prototype works with HTTP (World Wide Web) proxies. In addition, an analogous proxy for TELNET has been implemented. Proxies for FTP and SMTP are under development.},

  Abstract                 = {Mix networks are used to deliver messages anonymously to recipients, but do not straightforwardly allow the recipient of an anonymous message to reply to its sender. Yet the ability to reply one or more times, and to further reply to replies, is essential to a complete anonymous conversation. We propose a protocol that allows a sender of anonymous messages to establish a reusable anonymous return channel. This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply to different messages can not test whether two return channels are the same, and therefore can not learn whether they are replying to the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple replies through the same return channel helps defend against the counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels. In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the same number of messages. Our scheme resists these attacks because the replies sent by an attacker are mixed with other replies submitted by other recipients through the same return channel. Moreover, our protocol straightforwardly allows for replies to replies, etc. Our protocol is based upon a re-encryption mix network, and requires four times the amount of computation and communication of a basic mixnet.},

  Abstract                 = {Efforts to design faster synchronous mix networks have focused on reducing the computational cost of mixing per server. We propose a different approach: our re-encryption mixnet allows servers to mix inputs in parallel. The result is a dramatic reduction in overall mixing time for moderate-to-large numbers of servers. As measured in the model we describe, for n inputs and M servers our parallel re-encryption mixnet produces output in time at most 2n -- and only around n assuming a majority of honest servers. In contrast, a traditional, sequential, synchronous re-encryption mixnet requires time Mn.
Parallel re-encryption mixnets offer security guarantees comparable to those of synchronous mixnets, and in many cases only a slightly weaker guarantee of privacy. Our proposed construction is applicable to many recently proposed re-encryption mixnets, such as those of Furukawa and Sako, Neff, Jakobsson et al., and Golle and Boneh. In practice, parallel mixnets promise a potentially substantial time saving in applications such as anonymous electronic elections.},

  Abstract                 = {Dining cryptographers networks (or DC-nets) are a privacypreserving primitive devised by Chaum for anonymous message publication. A very attractive feature of the basic DC-net is its non-interactivity. Subsequent to key establishment, players may publish their messages in a single broadcast round, with no player-to-player communication. This feature is not possible in other privacy-preserving tools like mixnets. A drawback to DC-nets, however, is that malicious players can easily jam them, i.e., corrupt or block the transmission of messages from honest parties, and may do so without being traced. 
Several researchers have proposed valuable methods of detecting cheating players in DC-nets. This is usually at the cost, however, of multiple broadcast rounds, even in the optimistic case, and often of high computational and/or communications overhead, particularly for fault recovery. We present new DC-net constructions that simultaneously achieve noninteractivity and high-probability detection and identification of cheating players. Our proposals are quite eÂ±cient, imposing a basic cost that is linear in the number of participating players. Moreover, even in the case of cheating in our proposed system, just one additional broadcast round suÂ±ces for full fault recovery. Among other tools, our constructions employ bilinear maps, a recently popular cryptographic technique for reducing communication complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-latency anonymity systems such as Tor, AN.ON, Crowds, and Anonymizer.com aim to provide anonymous connections that are both untraceable by â€œlocalâ€? adversaries who control only a few machines and have low enough delay to support anonymous use of network services like Web browsing and remote login. One consequence of these goals is that these services leak some information about the network latency between the sender and one or more nodes in the system. We present two attacks on low-latency anonymity schemes using this information. The first attack allows a pair of colluding Web sites to predict, based on local timing information and with no additional resources, whether two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit with high confidence. The second attack requires more resources but allows a malicious Web site to gain several bits of information about a client each time he visits the site. We evaluate both attacks against two low-latency anonymity protocolsâ€”the Tor network and the MultiProxy proxy aggregator serviceâ€”and conclude that both are highly vulnerable to these attacks.},

New censorship-resistant communication systems such as SkypeMorph, StegoTorus, and CensorSpoofer aim to evade censorsâ€™ observations by imitating common protocols like Skype and HTTP. 
We demonstrate that these systems completely fail to achieve unobservability. Even a very weak, local censor can easily distinguish their traffic from the imitated protocols. We show dozens of passive and active methods that recognize even a single imitated session, without any need to correlate multiple network flows or perform sophisticated traffic analysis.
We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that â€œunobservability by imitationâ€? is a fundamentally flawed approach.We then present our recommendations for the design of unobservable communication systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Many users face surveillance of their Internet communications and a signifficant fraction suffer from outright blocking of certain destinations. Anonymous communication systems allow users to conceal the destinations they communicate with, but do not hide the fact that the users are using them. The mere use of such systems may invite suspicion, or access to them may be blocked. We therefore propose Cirripede, a system that can be used for unobservable communication with Internet destinations. Cirripede is designed to be deployed by ISPs; it intercepts connections from clients to innocent-looking destinations and redirects them to the true destination requested by the client. The communication is encoded in a way that is indistinguishable from normal communications to anyone without the master secret key, while public-key cryptography is used to eliminate the need for any secret information that must be shared with Cirripede users. Cirripede is designed to work scalably with routers that handle large volumes of traffic while imposing minimal over- head on ISPs and not disrupting existing traffic. This allows Cirripede proxies to be strategically deployed at central locations, making access to Cirripede very difficult to block. We built a proof-of-concept implementation of Cirripede and performed a testbed evaluation of its performance proper-

  Abstract                 = {There is a vast body of work on implementing anonymous communication. In this paper, we study the possibility of using anonymous communication as a building block, and show that one can leverage on anonymity in a variety of cryptographic contexts. Our results go in two directions:
- Feasibility. We show that anonymous communication over insecure channels can be used to implement unconditionally secure point-to-point channels, and hence general multi-party protocols with unconditional security in the presence of an honest majority. In contrast, anonymity cannot be generally used to obtain unconditional security when there is no honest majority.

- Efficiency. We show that anonymous channels can yield substantial efficiency improvements for several natural secure computation tasks. In particular, we present the first solution to the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) which can handle multiple users while being close to optimal with respect to both communication and computation. A key observation that underlies these results is that local randomization of inputs, via secret-sharing, when combined with the global mixing of the shares, provided by anonymity, allows to carry out use ful computations on the inputs while keeping the inputs private.},

The scheme takes a list of ElGamal encrypted messages, and produces as output a permuted list of encryptions of the same plaintext messages, such that corresponding items of the input and output cannot be correlated. For reasonably large inputs, the cost per participating server and element to be mixed is less than 200 modular multiplications, which is almost two orders of magnitude faster than the most efficient previously known method. The scheme has the novel feature of not requiring the knowledge of a secret key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the messages constituting the input to the mixÂ­network.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor, a distributed Internet anonymizing system, relies on volunteers who run dedicated relays. Other than altruism, these volunteers have no incentive to run relays, causing a large disparity between the number of users and available relays. We introduce BRAIDS, a set of practical mechanisms that encourages users to run Tor relays, allowing them to earn credits redeemable for improved performance of both interactive and non-interactive Tor trac. These performance incentives will allow Tor to support increasing resource demands with almost no loss in anonymity: BRAIDS is robust to well-known attacks. Using a simulation of 20,300 Tor nodes, we show that BRAIDS allows relays to achieve 75% lower latency than non-relays for interactive traffic, and 90% higher bandwidth utilization for non-interactive traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-latency anonymous communication protocols in general, and the popular onion-routing protocol in particular, are broken against simple timing attacks. While there have been few proposed solutions to this problem when the adversary is active, several padding schemes have been proposed to defend against a passive adversary that just observes timing patterns. Unfortunately active adversaries can break padding schemes by inserting delays and dropping messages. We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. 
Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not excessive.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel model of routing security that incorporates the ordinarily overlooked variations in trust that users have for dierent parts of the network. We focus on anonymous communication, and in particular onion routing, although we expect the approach to apply more broadly.
This paper provides two main contributions. First, we present a novel model to consider the various security concerns for route selection in anonymity networks when users vary their trust over parts of the network. Second, to show the usefulness of our model, we present as an example a new algorithm to select paths in onion routing. We analyze its effectiveness against deanonymization and other information leaks, and particularly how it fares in our model versus existing algorithms, which do not consider trust. In contrast to those, we find that our trust-based routing strategy can protect anonymity against an adversary capable of attacking a signifficant fraction of the network.},

Unlike other circumvention techniques, decoy routing does not require a client to connect to a specific IP address (which is easily blocked) in order to provide circumvention. We show that if it is possible for a client to connect to any unblocked host/service, then decoy routing could be used to connect them to a blocked destination without cooperation from the host. This is accomplished by placing the circumvention service in the network itself â€“ where a single device could proxy traffic between a significant fraction of hosts â€“ instead of at the edge.},

  Abstract                 = {Many people currently use proxies to circumvent government censorship that blocks access to content on the Internet. Unfortunately, the dissemination channels used to distribute proxy server locations are increasingly being monitored to discover and quickly block these proxies. This has given rise to a large number of ad hoc dissemination channels that leverage trust networks to reach legitimate users and at the same time prevent proxy server addresses from falling into the hands of censors. To address this problem in a more principled manner, we present Proximax, a robust system that continuously distributes pools of proxies to a large number of channels. The key research challenge in Proximax is to distribute the proxies among the different channels in a way that maximizes the usage of these proxies while minimizing the risk of having them blocked. This is challenging because of two conflicting goals: widely disseminating the location of the proxies to fully utilize their capacity and preventing (or at least delaying) their discovery by censors. We present a practical system that lays out a design and analytic al model that balances these factors.},

  Abstract                 = {With widespread acceptance of the Internet as a public medium for communication and information retrieval, there has been rising concern that the personal privacy of users can be eroded by cooperating network entities. A technical solution to maintaining privacy is to provide anonymity. We present a protocol for initiator anonymity called Hordes, which uses forwarding mechanisms similar to those used in previous protocols for sending data, but is the first protocol to make use of multicast routing to anonymously receive data. We show this results in shorter transmission latencies and requires less work of the protocol participants, in terms of the messages processed. We also present a comparison of the security and anonymity of Hordes with previous protocols, using the first quantitative definition of anonymity and unlinkability. Our analysis shows that Hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of Crowds and Onion Routing, but also that Hordes has numerous performance advantages.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymous blacklisting schemes allow online service providers to prevent future anonymous access by abusive users while preserving the privacy of all anonymous users (both abusive and non-abusive). The first scheme proposed for this purpose was Nymble, an extremely efficient scheme based only on symmetric primitives; however, Nymble relies on trusted third parties who can collude to de-anonymize users of the scheme. Two recently proposed schemes, Nymbler and Jack, reduce the trust placed in these third parties at the expense of using less-efficient asymmetric crypto primitives. We present BNymble, a scheme which matches the anonymity guarantees of Nymbler and Jack while (nearly) maintaining the efficiency of the original Nymble. The key insight of BNymble is that we can achieve the anonymity goals of these more recent schemes by replacing only the infrequent \User Registration" protocol from Nymble with asymmetric primitives. We prove the security of BNymble, and report on its eciency.},

In this paper, we show for the first time that even the most sophisticated timing-based watermarking schemes (e.g., RAINBOW and SWIRL) are not invisible by proposing a new detection system called BACKLIT. BACKLIT is designed according to the observation that any practical timing-based traffic watermark will cause noticeable alterations in the intrinsic timing features typical of TCP flows. We propose five metrics that are sufficient for detecting four state-of-the-art traffic watermarks for bulk transfer and interactive traffic. BACKLIT can be easily deployed in stepping stones and anonymity networks (e.g., Tor), because it does not rely on strong assumptions and can be realized in an active or passive mode. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate BACKLITâ€™s detection performance using the PlanetLab platform. The results show that BACKLIT can detect watermarked network flows with high accuracy and few false positives.},

To conceal as much information as possible when using variable (source routed) chains, all messages passed to mixes should be of the same length; thus, message length should not decrease when a mix transforms an input message into the corresponding output message directed at the next mix in the chain. Chaum described an implementation for such length-preserving mixes, but it is not secure against active attacks. We show how to build practical cryptographically secure lengthpreserving mixes. The conventional definition of security against chosen ciphertext attacks is not applicable to length-preserving mixes; we give an appropriate definition and show that our construction achieves provable security.},

Due to the increasing importance of privacy in the current society, formal methods will also become indispensable in this area.

We experimentally validate this conclusion by showing that â€œcircuit cloggingâ€? can identify client nodes using the MorphMix peer-to-peer anonymity protocol. We also propose and empirically validate the use of the Stochastic Fair Queueing discipline on outgoing connections as an efficient and low-cost mitigation technique.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network. Unlike previous proposals for P2P anonymity schemes, Torsk does not require all users to relay traffic for others. Torsk utilizes a combination of two P2P lookup mechanisms with complementary strengths in order to avoid attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of lookups. We show by analysis that previously known attacks on P2P anonymity schemes do not apply to Torsk, and report on experiments conducted with a 336-node wide-area deployment of Torsk, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication promise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulnerability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack, and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency P2P anonymous communication system, based on a random walk over a redundant structured topology. We base our design on shadows that redundantly check and certify neighbor
information; these certifications enable nodes to perform random walks over the structured topology while avoiding route capture and other attacks. 
We analytically calculate the anonymity provided by ShadowWalker and show that it performs well for moderate levels of attackers, and is much better than the state of the art. We also design an extension that improves forwarding performance at a slight anonymity cost, while at the same time protecting against selective DoS attacks. We show that our system has manageable overhead and can handle moderate churn, making it an attractive new design for P2P anonymous communication.},

We show that the techniques that are used to combat active attacks on the lookup mechanism dramatically increase information leaks and increase the efficacy of passive attacks. Thus there is a trade-off between robustness to active and passive attacks. 
We study this trade-off in two P2P anonymous systems, Salsa and AP3. In both cases, we find that, by combining both passive and active attacks, anonymity can be compromised much more effectively than previously thought, rendering these systems insecure for most proposed uses. Our results hold even if security parameters are changed or other improvements to the systems are considered. Our study therefore motivates the search for new approaches to P2P anonymous communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor is a volunteer-operated network of application-layer relays that enables users to communicate privately and anonymously. Unfortunately, Tor often exhibits poor performance due to congestion caused by the unbalanced ratio of clients to available relays, as well as a disproportionately high consumption of network capacity by a small fraction of filesharing users. This paper argues the very counterintuitive notion that slowing down traffic on Tor will increase the bandwidth capacity of the network and consequently improve the experience of interactive web users. We introduce Tortoise, a system for rate limiting Tor at its ingress points. We demonstrate that Tortoise incurs little penalty for interactive web users, while significantly decreasing the throughput for filesharers. Our techniques provide incentives to filesharers to configure their Tor clients to also relay traffic, which in turn improves the networkâ€™s overall performance. We present large-scale emulation results that indicate that interactive users will achieve a significant speedup if even a small fraction of clients opt to run relays.},

  Abstract                 = {Network information distribution is a fundamental service for any anonymization network. Even though anonymization and information distribution about the network are two orthogonal issues, the design of the distribution service has a direct impact on the anonymization. Requiring each node to know about all other nodes in the network (as in Tor and AN.ON -- the most popular anonymization networks) limits scalability and offers a playground for intersection attacks. The distributed designs existing so far fail to meet security requirements and have therefore not been accepted in real networks.

In this paper, we combine probabilistic analysis and simulation to explore DHT-based approaches for distributing network information in anonymization networks. Based on our findings we introduce NISAN, a novel approach that tries to scalably overcome known security problems. It allows for selecting nodes uniformly at random from the full set of all available peers, while each of the nodes has only limited knowledge about the network. We show that our scheme has properties similar to a centralized directory in terms of preventing malicious nodes from biasing the path selection. This is done, however, without requiring to trust any third party. At the same time our approach provides high scalability and adequate performance. Additionally, we analyze different design choices and come up with diverse proposals depending on the attacker model. The proposed combination of security, scalability, and simplicity, to the best of our knowledge, is not available in any other existing network information distribution system.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel attack targeting anonymizing systems. The attack involves placing a malicious relay node inside an anonymizing system and keeping legitimate nodes â€œbusy.â€? We achieve this by creating circular circuits and injecting fraudulent packets, crafted in a way that will make them spin an arbitrary number of times inside our artificial loops. At the same time we inject a small number of malicious nodes that we control into the anonymizing system. By keeping a significant part of the anonymizing system busy spinning useless packets, we increase the probability of having our nodes selected in the creation of legitimate circuits, since we have more free capacity to route requests than the legitimate nodes. This technique may lead to the compromise of the anonymity of people using the system.
To evaluate our novel attack, we used a real-world anonymizing system, TOR. We show that an anonymizing system that is composed of a series of relay nodes which perform cryptographic operations is vulnerable to our packet spinning attack. Our evaluation focuses on determining the cost we can introduce to the legitimate nodes by injecting the fraudulent packets, and the time required for a malicious client to create n-length TOR circuits. Furthermore we prove that routers that are involved in packet spinning do not have the capacity to process requests for the creation of new circuits and thus users are forced to select our malicious nodes for routing their data streams.},

  Abstract                 = {OneSwarm is a system for anonymous p2p file sharing in use by thousands of peers. It aims to provide Onion Routing-like privacy and BitTorrent-like performance. We demonstrate several aws in OneSwarm's design and implementation through three different attacks available to forensic investigators. First, we prove that the current design is vulnerable to a novel timing attack that allows just two attackers attached to the same target to determine if it is the source of queried content. When attackers comprise 15% of OneSwarm peers,
we expect over 90% of remaining peers will be attached to two attackers and therefore vulnerable. Thwarting the attack increases OneSwarm query response times, making them longer than the equivalent in Onion Routing. Second, we show that OneSwarm's vulnerability to traffic analysis by colluding attackers is much greater than was previously reported, and is much worse than Onion Routing. We show for this second attack that when investigators comprise 25% of peers, over 40% of the network can be investigated with 80% precision to find the sources of content. Our examination of the OneSwarm source code found differences with the technical paper that significantly reduce security. For the implementation in use by thousands of people, attackers that comprise 25% of the network can successfully use this second attack against 98% of remaining peers with 95% precision. Finally, we show that a novel application of a known TCP-based attack allows a single attacker to identify whether a neighbor is the source of data or a proxy for it. Users that turn off the default rate-limit setting are exposed. Each attack can be repeated as investigators leave and rejoin the network. All of our attacks are successful in a forensics context: Law enforcement can use them legally ahead of a warrant. Furthermore, private investigators, who have fewer restrictions on their behavior, can use them more easily in pursuit of evidence for such civil suits as copyright infringement.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional mix-based systems are composed of a small set of static, well known, and highly reliable mixes. To resist traffic analysis attacks at a mix, cover traffic must be used, which results in significant bandwidth overhead. End-to-end traffic analysis attacks are even more difficult to counter because there are only a few entry-and exit-points in the system. Static mix networks also suffer from scalability problems and in several countries, institutions operating a mix could be targeted by legal attacks. In this paper, we introduce MorphMix, a system for peer-to-peer based anonymous Internet usage. Each MorphMix node is a mix and anyone can easily join the system. We believe that MorphMix overcomes or reduces several drawbacks of static mix networks. In particular, we argue that our approach offers good protection from traffic analysis attacks without employing cover traffic. But MorphMix also introduces new challenges. One is that an adversary can easily operate several malicious nodes in the system and try to break the anonymity of legitimate users by getting full control over their anonymous paths. To counter this attack, we have developed a collusion detection mechanism, which allows to identify compromised paths with high probability before they are being used.},

  Abstract                 = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ? 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

  Abstract                 = {Decoy Routing is a new approach to Internet censorship circumvention that was recently and independently proposed at FOCIâ€™11, USENIX Securityâ€™11 and CCSâ€™11. Decoy routing aims to hamper nation-state level Internet censorship by having routers, rather than end hosts, relay traffic to blocked destinations. We analyze the security of these schemes against a routing capable adversary, a censoring authority that is willing to make routing decisions in response to decoy routing systems.

We explore China, Syria, Iran, and Egypt as routing capable adversaries, and evaluate several attacks that defeat the security goals of existing decoy routing proposals. In particular, we show that a routing capable adversary can enumerate the participating routers implementing these protocols; can successfully avoid sending traffic along routes containing these routers with little or no adverse effects; can identify users of these schemes through active and passive attacks; and in some cases can probabilistically identify connections to targeted destinations.},

  Abstract                 = {Anonymity on the Internet is a property commonly identified with privacy of elec-tronic communications. A number of different systems exist which claim to provideanonymous email and web browsing, but their effectiveness has hardly been evalu-ated in practice. In this thesis we focus on the anonymity properties of such systems.First, we show how the anonymity of anonymity systems can be quantified, pointingout flaws with existing metrics and proposing our own. In the process we distinguishthe anonymity of a message and that of an anonymity system.Secondly, we focus on the properties of building blocks of mix-based (email) anonym-ity systems, evaluating their resistance to powerful blending attacks, their delay, theiranonymity under normal conditions and other properties. This leads us to methodsof computing anonymity for a particular class of mixes â€“ timed mixes â€“ and a newbinomial mix.

Next, we look at the anonymity of a message going through an entire anonymitysystem based on a mix network architecture. We construct a semantics of a networkwith threshold mixes, define the information observable by an attacker, and give aprincipled definition of the anonymity of a message going through such a network.

We then consider low latency connection-based anonymity systems, giving concreteattacks and describing methods of protection against them. In particular, we showthat Peer-to-Peer anonymity systems provide less anonymity against the global passive adversary than ones based on a â€œclassicâ€? architecture.

Finally, we give an account of how anonymity can be used in censorship resistantsystems. These are designed to provide availability of documents, while facing threatsfrom a powerful adversary. We show how anonymity can be used to hide the identityof the servers where each of the documents are stored, thus making them harder toremove from the system},

Thus we are able to compare it to a threshold pool mix, and any future mixes that might be developed. Although we are only able to compute the anonymity of a timed pool mix after some speci c number of rounds, this is a practical approximation to the real anonymity.},

  Abstract                 = {We use the probabilistic model checker PRISM to analyze the Crowds system for anonymous Web browsing. This case study demonstrates how probabilistic model checking techniques can be used to formally analyze security properties of a peer-to-peer group communication system based on random message routing among members. The behavior of group members and the adversary is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain, and the desired security properties are expressed as PCTL formulas. The PRISM model checker is used to perform automated analysis of the system and verify anonymity guarantees it provides. Our main result is a demonstration of how certain forms of probabilistic anonymity degrade when group size increases or random routing paths are rebuilt, assuming that the corrupt group members are able to identify and/or correlate multiple routing paths originating from the same sender.},

  Abstract                 = {Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network.
One of the factors that causes the latency lies in Tor's circuit scheduling algorithm, which allows busy circuits (those with continuous traffic) to crowd out bursty circuits (those with short bursts of traffic). In this work, we propose and implement a more advanced scheduling algorithm which treats circuits differently, based on their recent activity. In this way, bursty circuits such as those used for web browsing can gain higher priority over busy ones such as used for bulk transfer; the performance for most activities over Tor is improved, while minimal overhead is incurred. Our algorithm has been incorporated into the latest build of Tor.},

  Abstract                 = {This work casts the traffic analysis of anonymity systems,and in particular mix networks, in the context of Bayesian inference. A generative probabilistic model of mix network architectures is presented, that incorporates a number of attack techniques in the traffic analysis literature. We use the model to build an Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference engine, that calculates the probabilities of who is talking to whom given an observation of network traces. We provide a thorough evaluation of its correctness and performance, and conrm that mix network with realistic parameters are secure. This approach enables us to apply established information theoretic anonymity metrics on complex mix networks, and extract information from anonymised traffic traces optimally.},

  Abstract                 = {Several credential systems have been proposed in which users can authenticate to service providers anonymously. Since anonymity can give users the license to misbehave, some variants allow the selective deanonymization (or linking) of misbehaving users upon a complaint to a Trusted Third Party (TTP). The ability of the TTP to revoke a userâ€™s privacy at any time, however, is too strong a punishment for misbehavior. To limit the scope of deanonymization, some systems have been proposed in which users can be deanonymized only if they authenticate â€œtoo many times,â€? such as â€œdouble spendingâ€? with electronic cash. While useful in some applications, such techniques cannot be generalized to more subjective definitions of misbehavior, for example, using such schemes it is not possible to block anonymous users who â€œdeface too many Web pagesâ€? on a Web site.},

This assumption is unrealistic in some networks, but it can be removed completely by using the fail-stop key generation schemes by WAIDNER (these proceedings).

  Abstract                 = {This work presents a cryptographic analysis of AN.ON's anonymization protocols. We have discovered three aws of differing severity. The first is caused by the fact that the freshness of the session key was not checked by the mix. This aw leads to a situation where an external attacker is able to perform a replay attack against AN.ON. A second, more severe, error was found in the encryption scheme of AN.ON. An internal attacker controlling the first mix in a cascade of length two is able to de-anonymize users with high probability. The third flaw results from the lack of checks to ensure that a message belongs to the current session. This enables an attacker to impersonate the last mix in a cascade.
The flaws we discovered represent errors that, unfortunately, still occur quite often and show the importance of either using standardized crytpographic protocols or performing detailed security analyses.},

Users in practice often need pseudonymity |sending messages intentionally linkable to each other but not to the sender|but pseudonymity in dynamic networks exposes users to intersection attacks. We present Buddies, the first systematic design for intersection attack resistance in practical anonymity systems. Buddies groups users dynamically into buddy sets, controlling message transmission to make buddies within a set behaviorally indistinguishable under traffic analysis. To manage the inevitable tradeoffs between anonymity guarantees and communication responsiveness, Buddies enables users to select independent attack mitigation policies for each pseudonym. Using trace-based simulations and a working prototype, we find that Buddies can guarantee non-trivial anonymity set sizes in realistic chat/microblogging scenarios, for both short-lived and long-lived pseudonyms.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has shown that properties of network traffic that remain observable after encryption, namely packet sizes and timing, can reveal surprising information about the trafficâ€™s contents (e.g., the language of a VoIP call [29], passwords in secure shell logins [20], or even web browsing habits [21, 14]). While there are some legitimate uses for encrypted traffic analysis, these techniques also raise important questions about the privacy of encrypted communications. A common tactic for mitigating such threats is to pad packets to uniform sizes or to send packets at fixed timing intervals; however, this approach is often inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel method for thwarting statistical traffic analysis algorithms by optimally morphing one class of traffic to look like another class. Through the use of convex optimization techniques, we show how to optimally modify packets in real-time to reduce the accuracy of a variety of traffic classifiers while incurring much less overhead than padding. Our evaluation of this technique against two published traffic classifiers for VoIP [29] and web traffic [14] shows that morphing works well on a wide range of network dataâ€”in some cases, simultaneously providing better privacy and lower overhead than naÂ¨Ä±ve defenses.},
