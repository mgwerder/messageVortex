  MessageVortex is a protocol which is aimed to maintain the anonymity of sender and 
  recipient of a message towards third parties. Unlike other protocols, it does not 
  provide an own transport protocol. Instead, it hides in common transport 
  facilities such as email (SMTP/IMAP) or chat (XMPP).
