MessageVortex is a protocol which is aimed to maintain the anonymity of sender and 
recipient of a message towards third parties. Unlike other protocols, it does not 
provide an own transport protocol. Instead, it hides in common transport 
facilities such as email (SMTP/IMAP) or chat (XMPP).
<br/>  
Currently published is only the draft of the RFC document. If you are interested in the project, feel free to contact the website owner.
<br/>  
A reference implementation in Java will be available in the download section soon. Just give it a try.
<br/>  
In the meantime feel free to read the RFC draft or the other docs.
