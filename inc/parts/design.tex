\section{Defining system boundaries}
\subsection{Thread model}
As an adverser we assume the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Available founding is huge.
\item can monitor all network traffic.
\item Can have own mixer infrastructure.
\item Is able to read, write or modify network data freely at any point of the net.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Discover message flows
\item Discover message contents
\item Identify users of the system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User model}
The assumed user of the system is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does care about privacy.
\item Has no special computer knowhow.
\item Has the ability to install a program or plugin.
\item Has no cryptographic knowhow.
\item Is using a device with enough calculation power to solve cryptographic tasks.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Send personal or confidential Information securely to another user
\end{itemize}
His expectations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item System should be easy to configure and maintain (in an ideal world: Zero touch). 
\item System should be fast.
\item System should be reliable.
\item System should work on any client he is using.
\item System should not be a legal problem to him or any of his peers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mail server admin model}
The assumed mail server admin of the system is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does care about privacy.
\item Has cosiderable computer knowhow.
\item Has the ability to install a program or plugin.
\item Has possibly no cryptographic knowhow.
\item Does know his own mail infrastructure
\item Is using a device with enough calculation power to solve cryptographic tasks.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support his users in sending personal or confidential information securely to another user
\end{itemize}
His expectations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item System should be easy to configure and maintain (in an ideal world: Zero touch). 
\item System should be fast.
\item System should be reliable.
\item System should work on any client he is using.
\item System should not be a legal problem to him or his company.
\end{itemize}
