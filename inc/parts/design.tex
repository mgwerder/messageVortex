\section{Defining system boundaries}
\subsection{Thread model}
As an adverser we assume the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Available founding is huge.
\item Can have own mailer infrastructure.
\item Is able to read, write or modify network data freely at any point of the net.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Discover message flows
\item Discover message contents
\item Identify users of the system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User model}
The assumed user of the system is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does care about privacy.
\item Has no special computer knowhow.
\item Has the ability to install a program or plugin.
\item Has no cryptographic knowhow.
\item Is using a device with enough calculation power to solve cryptographic tasks.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Send personal or confidential Information securely to another user
\end{itemize}
His expectations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item System should be easy to configure and maintain (in an ideal world: Zero touch). 
\item System should be fast.
\item System should be reliable.
\item System should work on any client he is using.
\item System should not be a legal problem to him or any of his peers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mail server admin model}
The assumed mail server admin of the system is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does care about privacy.
\item Has considerable computer knowhow.
\item Has the ability to install a program or plugin.
\item Has possibly no cryptographic knowhow.
\item Does know his own mail infrastructure.
\item Is using a device with enough calculation power to solve cryptographic tasks.
\end{itemize}
His intensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support his users in sending personal or confidential information securely to another user
\end{itemize}
His expectations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item System should be easy to configure and maintain (in an ideal world: Zero touch). 
\item System should be fast.
\item System should be reliable.
\item System should work on any client he is using.
\item System should not be a legal problem for him or his company.
\item System should still allow him to do regulatory tasks such as virus scanning or backup.
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Requirements of an Approach}
Different types of peers must be available:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Passive\\
	This peer is sending and receiving only. It works as a endpoint for communication and does only allow relay transfer for messages containing payload for this peer.
	\item Stealth\\
	This peer is behaving absolutely passive to unknown peers. No automatic replys are beeing sent unless the sender has been identified. Sender identification may be based on any criteria such as SMTP AUTH, known identity to vortex or knowledge about the public key of the recipient.
	\item public\\
	This peer is publicly known to be a participating peer. It may be used for local or relay delivery.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transport Layer Blending}
In order to blend into SMTP-Transport layer the following Criterias should be met:\par
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
	\def\fh{\multicolumn{1}{|l}{\textbf{Criteria}} &
	\multicolumn{1}{|l}{\textbf{Parameter}} &
	\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{\textbf{Reason}}}
	\tablefirsthead{\hline\fh\\\hline}
	\tablehead{\hline\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\small\slshape continued from previous page}\\\hline\fh\\\hline}
	\tabletail{\hline\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{\small\slshape continued on next page}\\\hline}
	\tablelasttail{}
	\bottomcaption{Transport layer decisions}
  \begin{supertabular}{|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3cm}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3cm}|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{6cm}|}
		SMTP address & May have non mandatory extensions & SMTP adresses may have extension. However, these extensions must not be mandatory since a target address must be able to be in stealth mode\\\hline
		Transfer channel negotiation & Should always use SMTPS or STARTTLS & Hide immediate peer partners. This increases amount of work to be done for analyzing traffic.\\\hline
		encoding mime message & Should always use Base64 & Any other encoding would differentiate MailVotex from regular traffic\\\hline
		Transport media & Attachment & May be any kind of attachment. Recommended are mime types which have no verifiable structures such as .raw or .pcm files to avoid detection thru content analysis.\\\hline
