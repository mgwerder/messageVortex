  abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate how to reduce the overhead and delay
	of circuit establishment in the Tor anonymizing network by using
	predistributed Diffie-Hellman values. We eliminate the use of RSA
	encryption and decryption from circuit setup, and we reduce the number
	of DH exponentiations vs. the current Tor circuit setup protocol
	while maintaining immediate forward secrecy. We also describe savings
	that can be obtained by precomputing during idle cycles values that
	can be determined before the protocol starts. We introduce the distinction
	of eventual vs. immediate forward secrecy and present protocols that
	illustrate the distinction. These protocols are even more efficient
	in communication and computation than the one we primarily propose,
	but they provide only eventual forward secrecy. We describe how to
	reduce the overhead and the complexity of hidden server connections
	by using our DH-values to implement valet nodes and eliminate the
	need for rendezvous points as they exist today. We also discuss the
	security of the new elements and an analysis of efficiency improvements.},

	there is no fear of retribution. As a deterrent, or means to revocation,
	various schemes for accountable anonymity feature some kind of (possibly
	distributed) trusted third party (TTP) with the power to identify
	or link misbehaving users. Recently, schemes such as BLAC and PEREA
	showed how anonymous revocation can be achieved without such TTPs—anonymous
	users can be revoked if they misbehave, and yet nobody can identify
	or link such users cryptographically. Despite being the state of
	the art in anonymous revocation, these schemes allow only a basic
	form of revocation amounting to ‘revoke anybody with d or more misbehaviors’
	or ‘revoke anybody whose combined misbehavior score is too high’
	(where misbehaviors are assigned a ‘severity’ score). We present
	BLACR, which significantly advances anonymous revocation in three
	ways: 1) It constitutes a first attempt to generalize reputation-based
	anonymous revocation, where negative or positive scores can be assigned
	to anonymous sessions across multiple categories. Servers can block
	users based on policies, which specify a boolean combination of reputations
	in these categories; 2) We present a weighted extension, which allows
	the total severity score to ramp up for multiple misbehaviors by
	the same user; and, 3) We make a significant improvement in authentication
	times through a technique we call express lane authentication, which
	makes reputation-based anonymous revocation practical.},

	We investigate how Tor's routing optimizations impact its ability

	we show the extent to which routing performance optimizations have
	left the system vulnerable to end-to-end traffic analysis attacks
	from non-global adversaries with minimal resources. Further, we demonstrate
	that entry guards, added to mitigate path disruption attacks, are
	themselves vulnerable to attack. Finally, we explore solutions to
	improve Tor's current routing algorithms and propose alternative
	routing strategies that prevent some of the routing attacks used

	To describe our protocols, buses are used as a metaphor: Buses, i.e.,
	messages, are traveling on the network, each piece of information
	is allocated a seat within the bus. Routes are chosen and buses are
	scheduled to traverse these routes. Deterministic and randomized
	protocols are presented, the protocols differ in the number of buses
	in the system, the worst case traveling time, and the required buffer
	size in a ``station.'' In particular, a protocol that is based on
	cluster partition of the network is presented; in this protocol there
	is one bus traversing each cluster. The clusters' size in the partition
	gives time and communication tradeoffs. One advantage of our protocols
	over previous works is that they are not based on statistical properties
	for the communication pattern. Another advantage is that they only
	require the processors in the communication network to be busy periodically.},

  abstract = {A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to retrieve
	a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item
	being retrieved. In a t-private, k-server PIR protocol the database
	is replicated among k servers, and the user’s privacy is protected
	from any collusion of up to t servers. The main cost-measure of such
	protocols is the communication complexity of retrieving a single
	bit of data. This work addresses the information-theoretic setting
	for PIR, in which the user’s privacy should be unconditionally protected
	from collusions of servers. We present a unified general construction,
	whose abstract components can be instantiated to yield both old and
	new families of PIR protocols. A main ingredient in the new protocols
	is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam to
	a communication complexity problem in the so-called simultaneous
	messages model.
	
	Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and
	resolves some previous anomalies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t-private
	k-server PIR protocols with communication O(n1/b(2k−1)/tc), where
	n is the database size. For t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic
	improvement over the previous state of the art; (2) a constant-factor
	improvement in the communication complexity of 1-private PIR, providing
	the first improvement to the 2-server case since PIR protocols were
	introduced; (3) efficient PIR protocols with logarithmic query length.
	The latter protocols have applications to the construction of efficient
	families of locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR
	protocols with reduced work by the servers.},

	PIR protocols the database is replicated among k servers, and each
	server learns nothing about the item the user retrieves. The cost
	of such protocols is measured by the communication complexity of
	retrieving one out of n bits of data. For any fixed k, the complexity
	of the best protocols prior to our work was O(n^(1/(2k-1)) (Ambainis,
	1997). Since then several methods were developed in an attempt to
	beat this bound, but all these methods yielded the same asymptotic
	bound.
	
	In this work, this barrier is finally broken and the complexity of
	information-theoretic k-server PIR is improved to n^O( (log log k)/(k
	log k) ). The new PIR protocols can also be used to construct k-query
	binary locally decodable codes of length exp(n^O( (log log k)/(k
	log k) )), compared to exp(n^(1/(k-1)) in previous constructions.
	The improvements presented in this paper apply even for small values

	k >= 4.},

	1995. The standard definition of PIR protocols raises a simple question
	– what happens if some of the servers crash during the operation?
	How can we devise a protocol which still works in the presence of
	crashing servers? Current systems do not guarantee availability of
	servers at all times for many reasons, e.g., crash of server or communication
	problems. Our purpose is to design robust PIR protocols, i.e., protocols
	which still work correctly even if only k out of ` servers are available
	during the protocols’ operation (the user does not know in advance
	which servers are available).
	
	
	We present various robust PIR protocols giving different tradeoffs
	between the different parameters. These protocols are incomparable,
	i.e., for different values of n and k we will get better results
	using different protocols. We first present a generic transformation
	from regular PIR protocols to robust PIR protocols, this transformation
	is important since any improvement in the communication complexity
	of regular PIR protocol will immediately implicate improvement in
	the robust PIR protocol communication. We also present two specific
	robust PIR protocols. Finally, we present robust PIR protocols which
	can tolerate Byzantine servers, i.e., robust PIR protocols which
	still work in the presence of malicious servers or servers with corrupted

	Our proof technique is markedly different than previous work. We establish

	language to attack the problem. We introduce “obscurant networks”
	- networks that can obscure the destination of each particular player,
	and we show almost all executions of the protocol include such a
	network. The security guarantee we supply is very strong. It shows
	the adversary learns almost no information about any subset of players.
	Remarkably, we show that this guarantee holds even if the adversary
	has a-priori information about communication patters (e.g., people

	forward secrecy in a fully non-interactive fashion, without requiring
	any communication from the router and/or the users and the service
	provider to update time-related keys. We compare this to TOR which
	requires O(n2) rounds of interaction to establish a circuit of size
	n. In terms of the computational effort required to the parties,
	our protocol is comparable to TOR, but the network latency associated
	with TOR’s high round complexity ends up dominating the running time.
	Compared to other recently proposed alternative to TOR (such as the
	PB-OR and CL-OR protocols) our scheme still has the advantage of
	being non-interactive (both PB-OR and CL-OR require some interaction
	to update time-sensitive information), and achieves similar computational
	performances. We performed extensive implementation and simulation
	tests that confirm our theoretical analysis. Additionally, while
	comparing our scheme to PB-OR, we discovered a flaw in the security
	of that scheme which we repair in this paper. Our solution is based
	on the application of forward-secure encryption. We design a forward-secure
	encryption scheme (of independent interest) to be used as the main
	encryption scheme in an onion routing protocol.},

  abstract = {This thesis contributes to the field of anonymous communications over
	widely deployed communication networks. It describes novel schemes
	to protect anonymity; it also presents powerful new attacks and new
	ways of analysing and understanding anonymity properties. We present
	Mixminion, a new generation anonymous remailer, and examine its security
	against all known passive and active cryptographic attacks. We use
	the secure anonymous replies it provides, to describe a pseudonym
	server, as an example of the anonymous protocols that mixminion can
	support. The security of mix systems is then assessed against a compulsion
	threat model, in which an adversary can request the decryption of
	material from honest nodes. A new construction, the fs-mix, is presented
	that makes tracing messages by such an adversary extremely expensive.
	
	Moving beyond the static security of anonymous communication protocols,
	we define a metric based on information theory that can be used to
	measure anonymity. The analysis of the pool mix serves as an example
	of its use. We then create a framework within which we compare the
	traffic analysis resistance provided by different mix network topologies.
	A new topology, based on expander graphs, proves to be e±cient and
	secure. The rgb-mix is also presented; this implements a strategy
	to detect flooding attacks against honest mix nodes and neutralise
	them by the use of cover traffic.
	
	Finally a set of generic attacks are studied. Statistical disclosure
	attacks model the whole anonymous system as a black box, and are
	able to uncover the relationships between long-term correspondents.
	Stream attacks trace streams of data travelling through anonymizing
	networks, and uncover the communicating parties very quickly. They
	both use statistical methods to drastically reduce the anonymity
	of users. Other minor attacks are described against peer discovery
	and route reconstruction in anonymous networks, as well as the na¨ive
	use of anonymous replies.},

  abstract = {Mix networks are used to deliver messages anonymously to recipients,
	but do not straightforwardly allow the recipient of an anonymous
	message to reply to its sender. Yet the ability to reply one or more
	times, and to further reply to replies, is essential to a complete
	anonymous conversation. We propose a protocol that allows a sender
	of anonymous messages to establish a reusable anonymous return channel.
	This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages
	to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply
	to different messages can not test whether two return channels are
	the same, and therefore can not learn whether they are replying to
	the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple
	replies through the same return channel helps defend against the
	counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels.
	In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by
	sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the

  abstract = {This thesis presents information theoretic anonymity metrics and various
	analysis of anonymous communication nodes. Our contributions are
	a step towards the understanding of anonymity properties and the
	development of robust anonymous communications. Anonymous communications
	are an essential building block for privacy-enhanced applications,
	as the data available at the communication layer may leak critical
	private information.
	
	One of the main contributions of our work is the degree of anonymity,
	a practical information theoretic anonymity metric. Entropy-based
	anonymity metrics can be applied to measure the degree of anonymity
	provided by an anonymous service to its users. In particular, these
	metrics can be applied to systems which leak probabilistic relationships
	between the anonymous subjects and their transactions. We present
	a taxonomy of the two main building blocks used to implement anonymous
	communication networks, which are anonymous communication nodes (called
	mixes) and cover traffic policies (called dummy traffic). We propose
	a model for describing anonymous communication nodes which extends
	design possibilities and facilitates the analysis of anonymity properties.
	We identify the parameters which must be taken into account in the
	design and analysis of mix-based anonymous communication networks.
	
	In order to show the practical applications of information theoretic
	anonymity metrics, we have applied the metrics to evaluate the anonymity
	properties of various nodes for anonymous communication which have
	been proposed in the literature. We analyze the anonymity provided
	by these nodes when subject to passive and active attacks, while
	considering scenarios with and without cover traffic techniques.
	
	We have analyzed two working implementations of anonymous email in
	real traffic conditions. The tools used for the analysis are information
	theoretic metrics and our model for anonymous communication nodes.
	We show that anonymous email traffic patterns are hard to predict
	and no assumptions on them should be made. We find that the two studied
	designs offer very different tradeoffs for anonymity and performance.
	
	All in all, we believe that information theoretic metrics are a useful
	tool to characterize anonymity properties. Our work is one step towards
	a better understanding of anonymity and our results can be used for
	the design of robust anonymity technologies.},

  abstract = {In 2005, Murdoch and Danezis demonstrated the first practical congestion
	attack against a deployed anonymity network. They could identify
	which relays were on a target Tor user’s path by building paths one
	at a time through every Tor relay and introducing congestion. However,
	the original attack was performed on only 13 Tor relays on the nascent
	and lightly loaded Tor network. We show that the attack from their
	paper is no longer practical on today’s 1500-relay heavily loaded
	Tor network. The attack doesn’t scale because a) the attacker needs
	a tremendous amount of bandwidth to measure enough relays during
	the attack window, and b) there are too many false positives now
	that many other users are adding congestion at the same time as the
	attacks. We then strengthen the original congestion attack by combining
	it with a novel bandwidth amplification attack based on a flaw in
	the Tor design that lets us build long circuits that loop back on
	themselves. We show that this new combination attack is practical
	and effective by demonstrating a working attack on today’s deployed
	Tor network. By coming up with a model to better understand Tor’s
	routing behavior under congestion, we further provide a statistical
	analysis characterizing how effective our attack is in each case.},

	treatment from players who have established positive reputations.
	One might hope for an open society where newcomers are treated well,
	but there is an inherent social cost in making the spread of reputations
	optional. We prove that no equilibrium can sustain significantly
	more cooperation than the dues-paying equilibrium in a repeated random
	matching game with a large number of players in which players have
	finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there
	is a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes. Although one
	could remove the ineciency of mistreating newcomers by disallowing
	anonymity, this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of

	to be trusted but excludes some players with low payoffs, thus introducing
	a different inefficiency. We also discuss the use of free but unreplaceable

	signal over the Tor network that can be detected using traffic analysis.
	It is delivered by a malicious exit node using a man-in-the-middle
	attack on HTTP. Both the attack and the traffic analysis can be performed
	by an adversary with limited resources. While the attack can only
	succeed if the attacker controls one of the victim’s entry guards,
	the method reduces the time required for a traffic analysis attack
	on Tor from O(nk) to O(n + k), where n is the number of exit nodes
	and k is the number of entry guards. This paper presents techniques
	that exploit the Tor exit policy system to greatly simplify the traffic
	analysis. The fundamental vulnerability exposed by this paper is
	not specific to Tor but rather to the problem of anonymous web browsing
	itself. This paper also describes a related attack on users who toggle
	the use of Tor with the popular Firefox extension Torbutton.},

  abstract = {Mix networks are used to deliver messages anonymously to recipients,
	but do not straightforwardly allow the recipient of an anonymous
	message to reply to its sender. Yet the ability to reply one or more
	times, and to further reply to replies, is essential to a complete
	anonymous conversation. We propose a protocol that allows a sender
	of anonymous messages to establish a reusable anonymous return channel.
	This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages
	to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply
	to different messages can not test whether two return channels are
	the same, and therefore can not learn whether they are replying to
	the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple
	replies through the same return channel helps defend against the
	counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels.
	In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by
	sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the
	same number of messages. Our scheme resists these attacks because
	the replies sent by an attacker are mixed with other replies submitted
	by other recipients through the same return channel. Moreover, our
	protocol straightforwardly allows for replies to replies, etc. Our
	protocol is based upon a re-encryption mix network, and requires
	four times the amount of computation and communication of a basic
	mixnet.},

	reducing the computational cost of mixing per server. We propose
	a different approach: our re-encryption mixnet allows servers to
	mix inputs in parallel. The result is a dramatic reduction in overall
	mixing time for moderate-to-large numbers of servers. As measured
	in the model we describe, for n inputs and M servers our parallel
	re-encryption mixnet produces output in time at most 2n -- and only
	around n assuming a majority of honest servers. In contrast, a traditional,
	sequential, synchronous re-encryption mixnet requires time Mn.
	
	Parallel re-encryption mixnets offer security guarantees comparable
	to those of synchronous mixnets, and in many cases only a slightly
	weaker guarantee of privacy. Our proposed construction is applicable
	to many recently proposed re-encryption mixnets, such as those of
	Furukawa and Sako, Neff, Jakobsson et al., and Golle and Boneh. In

  abstract = {Dining cryptographers networks (or DC-nets) are a privacypreserving
	primitive devised by Chaum for anonymous message publication. A very
	attractive feature of the basic DC-net is its non-interactivity.
	Subsequent to key establishment, players may publish their messages
	in a single broadcast round, with no player-to-player communication.
	This feature is not possible in other privacy-preserving tools like
	mixnets. A drawback to DC-nets, however, is that malicious players
	can easily jam them, i.e., corrupt or block the transmission of messages
	from honest parties, and may do so without being traced. 
	
	Several researchers have proposed valuable methods of detecting cheating
	players in DC-nets. This is usually at the cost, however, of multiple
	broadcast rounds, even in the optimistic case, and often of high
	computational and/or communications overhead, particularly for fault
	recovery. We present new DC-net constructions that simultaneously
	achieve noninteractivity and high-probability detection and identification
	of cheating players. Our proposals are quite e±cient, imposing a
	basic cost that is linear in the number of participating players.
	Moreover, even in the case of cheating in our proposed system, just
	one additional broadcast round su±ces for full fault recovery. Among
	other tools, our constructions employ bilinear maps, a recently popular
	cryptographic technique for reducing communication complexity.},

	local timing information and with no additional resources, whether
	two connections from the same Tor exit node are using the same circuit

	allows a malicious Web site to gain several bits of information about

	using them. The mere use of such systems may invite suspicion, or
	access to them may be blocked. We therefore propose Cirripede, a
	system that can be used for unobservable communication with Internet
	destinations. Cirripede is designed to be deployed by ISPs; it intercepts
	connections from clients to innocent-looking destinations and redirects
	them to the true destination requested by the client. The communication
	is encoded in a way that is indistinguishable from normal communications
	to anyone without the master secret key, while public-key cryptography
	is used to eliminate the need for any secret information that must
	be shared with Cirripede users. Cirripede is designed to work scalably
	with routers that handle large volumes of traffic while imposing
	minimal over- head on ISPs and not disrupting existing traffic. This
	allows Cirripede proxies to be strategically deployed at central
	locations, making access to Cirripede very difficult to block. We
	built a proof-of-concept implementation of Cirripede and performed
	a testbed evaluation of its performance proper-

	In this paper, we study the possibility of using anonymous communication
	as a building block, and show that one can leverage on anonymity
	in a variety of cryptographic contexts. Our results go in two directions:
	
	- Feasibility. We show that anonymous communication over insecure
	channels can be used to implement unconditionally secure point-to-point
	channels, and hence general multi-party protocols with unconditional
	security in the presence of an honest majority. In contrast, anonymity
	cannot be generally used to obtain unconditional security when there
	is no honest majority.
	
	
	- Efficiency. We show that anonymous channels can yield substantial
	efficiency improvements for several natural secure computation tasks.
	In particular, we present the first solution to the problem of private
	information retrieval (PIR) which can handle multiple users while
	being close to optimal with respect to both communication and computation.
	A key observation that underlies these results is that local randomization
	of inputs, via secret-sharing, when combined with the global mixing
	of the shares, provided by anonymity, allows to carry out use ful
	computations on the inputs while keeping the inputs private.},

  abstract = {Low-latency anonymous communication protocols in general, and the
	popular onion-routing protocol in particular, are broken against
	simple timing attacks. While there have been few proposed solutions
	to this problem when the adversary is active, several padding schemes
	have been proposed to defend against a passive adversary that just
	observes timing patterns. Unfortunately active adversaries can break
	padding schemes by inserting delays and dropping messages. We present
	a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by
	using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive
	adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous
	communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme
	against passive attacks. 
	
	Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily
	good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We
	also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world
	performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not

	that blocks access to content on the Internet. Unfortunately, the

	manner, we present Proximax, a robust system that continuously distributes
	pools of proxies to a large number of channels. The key research
	challenge in Proximax is to distribute the proxies among the different
	channels in a way that maximizes the usage of these proxies while
	minimizing the risk of having them blocked. This is challenging because
	of two conflicting goals: widely disseminating the location of the
	proxies to fully utilize their capacity and preventing (or at least
	delaying) their discovery by censors. We present a practical system

	a comparison of the security and anonymity of Hordes with previous

	that Hordes has numerous performance advantages.},

	and privacy applications, such as tracing botnet C&C communications
	and deanonymizing peer-to-peer VoIP calls. The stateof- the-art traffic
	watermarking schemes are usually based on packet timing information
	and they are notoriously difficult to detect. In this paper, we show
	for the first time that even the most sophisticated timing-based
	watermarking schemes (e.g., RAINBOW and SWIRL) are not invisible
	by proposing a new detection system called BACKLIT. BACKLIT is designed
	according to the observation that any practical timing-based traffic
	watermark will cause noticeable alterations in the intrinsic timing
	features typical of TCP flows. We propose five metrics that are sufficient
	for detecting four state-of-the-art traffic watermarks for bulk transfer
	and interactive traffic. BACKLIT can be easily deployed in stepping
	stones and anonymity networks (e.g., Tor), because it does not rely
	on strong assumptions and can be realized in an active or passive
	mode. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate BACKLIT’s
	detection performance using the PlanetLab platform. The results show
	that BACKLIT can detect watermarked network flows with high accuracy
	and few false positives.},

	relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity
	network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and
	maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new
	attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay

	a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and

	proposals for P2P anonymity schemes, Torsk does not require all users
	to relay traffic for others. Torsk utilizes a combination of two
	P2P lookup mechanisms with complementary strengths in order to avoid
	attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of lookups. We show
	by analysis that previously known attacks on P2P anonymity schemes
	do not apply to Torsk, and report on experiments conducted with a
	336-node wide-area deployment of Torsk, demonstrating its efficiency

  abstract = {Tor is a volunteer-operated network of application-layer relays that

	Tor often exhibits poor performance due to congestion caused by the

	high consumption of network capacity by a small fraction of filesharing

	We introduce Tortoise, a system for rate limiting Tor at its ingress
	points. We demonstrate that Tortoise incurs little penalty for interactive
	web users, while significantly decreasing the throughput for filesharers.
	Our techniques provide incentives to filesharers to configure their
	Tor clients to also relay traffic, which in turn improves the network’s
	overall performance. We present large-scale emulation results that

	anonymization network. Even though anonymization and information
	distribution about the network are two orthogonal issues, the design
	of the distribution service has a direct impact on the anonymization.
	Requiring each node to know about all other nodes in the network
	(as in Tor and AN.ON -- the most popular anonymization networks)
	limits scalability and offers a playground for intersection attacks.
	The distributed designs existing so far fail to meet security requirements
	and have therefore not been accepted in real networks.
	
	
	In this paper, we combine probabilistic analysis and simulation to
	explore DHT-based approaches for distributing network information
	in anonymization networks. Based on our findings we introduce NISAN,
	a novel approach that tries to scalably overcome known security problems.
	It allows for selecting nodes uniformly at random from the full set
	of all available peers, while each of the nodes has only limited
	knowledge about the network. We show that our scheme has properties
	similar to a centralized directory in terms of preventing malicious
	nodes from biasing the path selection. This is done, however, without
	requiring to trust any third party. At the same time our approach
	provides high scalability and adequate performance. Additionally,
	we analyze different design choices and come up with diverse proposals
	depending on the attacker model. The proposed combination of security,
	scalability, and simplicity, to the best of our knowledge, is not
	available in any other existing network information distribution
	system.},

  abstract = {We present a novel attack targeting anonymizing systems. The attack
	involves placing a malicious relay node inside an anonymizing system
	and keeping legitimate nodes “busy.” We achieve this by creating
	circular circuits and injecting fraudulent packets, crafted in a
	way that will make them spin an arbitrary number of times inside
	our artificial loops. At the same time we inject a small number of
	malicious nodes that we control into the anonymizing system. By keeping
	a significant part of the anonymizing system busy spinning useless
	packets, we increase the probability of having our nodes selected
	in the creation of legitimate circuits, since we have more free capacity
	to route requests than the legitimate nodes. This technique may lead
	to the compromise of the anonymity of people using the system.
	
	To evaluate our novel attack, we used a real-world anonymizing system,
	TOR. We show that an anonymizing system that is composed of a series
	of relay nodes which perform cryptographic operations is vulnerable
	to our packet spinning attack. Our evaluation focuses on determining

  abstract = {OneSwarm is a system for anonymous p2p file sharing in use by thousands
	of peers. It aims to provide Onion Routing-like privacy and BitTorrent-like
	performance. We demonstrate several aws in OneSwarm's design and
	implementation through three different attacks available to forensic
	investigators. First, we prove that the current design is vulnerable
	to a novel timing attack that allows just two attackers attached
	to the same target to determine if it is the source of queried content.
	When attackers comprise 15% of OneSwarm peers,
	
	we expect over 90% of remaining peers will be attached to two attackers
	and therefore vulnerable. Thwarting the attack increases OneSwarm
	query response times, making them longer than the equivalent in Onion
	Routing. Second, we show that OneSwarm's vulnerability to traffic
	analysis by colluding attackers is much greater than was previously
	reported, and is much worse than Onion Routing. We show for this
	second attack that when investigators comprise 25% of peers, over
	40% of the network can be investigated with 80% precision to find
	the sources of content. Our examination of the OneSwarm source code
	found differences with the technical paper that significantly reduce
	security. For the implementation in use by thousands of people, attackers
	that comprise 25% of the network can successfully use this second
	attack against 98% of remaining peers with 95% precision. Finally,
	we show that a novel application of a known TCP-based attack allows
	a single attacker to identify whether a neighbor is the source of
	data or a proxy for it. Users that turn off the default rate-limit
	setting are exposed. Each attack can be repeated as investigators
	leave and rejoin the network. All of our attacks are successful in
	a forensics context: Law enforcement can use them legally ahead of
	a warrant. Furthermore, private investigators, who have fewer restrictions
	on their behavior, can use them more easily in pursuit of evidence
	for such civil suits as copyright infringement.},

  title = {On the Anonymity of Anonymity Systems},
  school = {University of Cambridge},
  year = {2004},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {Anonymity on the Internet is a property commonly identified with privacy
	of elec-tronic communications. A number of different systems exist
	which claim to provideanonymous email and web browsing, but their
	effectiveness has hardly been evalu-ated in practice. In this thesis
	we focus on the anonymity properties of such systems.First, we show
	how the anonymity of anonymity systems can be quantified, pointingout
	flaws with existing metrics and proposing our own. In the process
	we distinguishthe anonymity of a message and that of an anonymity
	system.Secondly, we focus on the properties of building blocks of
	mix-based (email) anonym-ity systems, evaluating their resistance
	to powerful blending attacks, their delay, theiranonymity under normal
	conditions and other properties. This leads us to methodsof computing
	anonymity for a particular class of mixes – timed mixes – and a newbinomial
	mix.
	
	
	Next, we look at the anonymity of a message going through an entire
	anonymitysystem based on a mix network architecture. We construct
	a semantics of a networkwith threshold mixes, define the information
	observable by an attacker, and give aprincipled definition of the
	anonymity of a message going through such a network.
	
	
	We then consider low latency connection-based anonymity systems, giving
	concreteattacks and describing methods of protection against them.
	In particular, we showthat Peer-to-Peer anonymity systems provide
	less anonymity against the global passive adversary than ones based
	on a “classic” architecture.
	
	
	Finally, we give an account of how anonymity can be used in censorship
	resistantsystems. These are designed to provide availability of documents,
	while facing threatsfrom a powerful adversary. We show how anonymity
	can be used to hide the identityof the servers where each of the
	documents are stored, thus making them harder toremove from the system},

	run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users'
	privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers,
	thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient.
	Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also
	brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the
	network.
	
	One of the factors that causes the latency lies in Tor's circuit scheduling
	algorithm, which allows busy circuits (those with continuous traffic)
	to crowd out bursty circuits (those with short bursts of traffic).
	In this work, we propose and implement a more advanced scheduling
	algorithm which treats circuits differently, based on their recent
	activity. In this way, bursty circuits such as those used for web
	browsing can gain higher priority over busy ones such as used for
	bulk transfer; the performance for most activities over Tor is improved,
	while minimal overhead is incurred. Our algorithm has been incorporated
	into the latest build of Tor.},

	useful in some applications, such techniques cannot be generalized

	use today. Technically they are realized as overlays, i. e., they
	add another instance of routing, forwarding, and transport functionality

	subtle) implications, as overlay and underlay may interact. Far too
	often, existing designs neglect this. Consequently, they suffer from
	performance issues that are hard to track down and fix. The existing
	body of work in this area often takes a quite narrow view, tweaking
	the design in order to improve one specific aspect. The behavior
	of the interacting underlay and overlay transport layers is complex,
	though, and often causes unexpected-and unexplored-side effects.
	Therefore, we show that so far considered combinations of overlay

	fairness at the same time, and we establish guidelines for a future,
	better suited transport layer design.},

	A second, more severe, error was found in the encryption scheme of

	The third flaw results from the lack of checks to ensure that a message

	The flaws we discovered represent errors that, unfortunately, still

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that properties of network traffic that remain
	observable after encryption, namely packet sizes and timing, can
	reveal surprising information about the traffic’s contents (e.g.,
	the language of a VoIP call [29], passwords in secure shell logins
	[20], or even web browsing habits [21, 14]). While there are some
	legitimate uses for encrypted traffic analysis, these techniques
	also raise important questions about the privacy of encrypted communications.
	A common tactic for mitigating such threats is to pad packets to
	uniform sizes or to send packets at fixed timing intervals; however,
	this approach is often inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel
	method for thwarting statistical traffic analysis algorithms by optimally
	morphing one class of traffic to look like another class. Through
	the use of convex optimization techniques, we show how to optimally
	modify packets in real-time to reduce the accuracy of a variety of
	traffic classifiers while incurring much less overhead than padding.
	Our evaluation of this technique against two published traffic classifiers
	for VoIP [29] and web traffic [14] shows that morphing works well
	on a wide range of network data—in some cases, simultaneously providing
	better privacy and lower overhead than na¨ıve defenses.},
