  abstract = {Tor is one of the most widely-used privacy enhancing technologies
	for achieving online anonymity and resisting censorship. Simultaneously,
	Tor is also an evolving research network on which investigators perform
	experiments to improve the network’s resilience to attacks and enhance
	its performance. Existing methods for studying Tor have included
	analytical modeling, simulations, small-scale network emulations,
	small-scale PlanetLab deployments, and measurement and analysis of
	the live Tor network. Despite the growing body of work concerning
	Tor, there is no widely accepted methodology for conducting Tor research
	in a manner that preserves realism while protecting live users’ privacy.
	In an effort to propose a standard, rigorous experimental framework
	for conducting Tor research in a way that ensures safety and realism,
	we present the design of ExperimenTor, a largescale Tor network emulation
	toolkit and testbed. We also report our early experiences with prototype
	testbeds currently deployed at four research institutions.},
